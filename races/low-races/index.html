They are quite strong with their Ki and have a talent for flying, but are physically one of the weakest races. Chou-jin are born in Heaven, created from a sinless soul and granted eternal life in a playful form. Though, most tend to grow into a mature being far wiser than their appearance gives them credit. Their life in Heaven is always short as they are simply given bodies, allowed a few days to adjust to them, then sent into the Neoverse. Like babies few ever remember their first few days. Furthermore, they may have been born in Heaven, but not all stay to a straight path.</p> <p>Despite their inability to breed (due to their young age), these beings do have different genders. Being that the Chou-jin are not raised by any parental figures, they have no common cultural ties. One of the few ties these children share is that most look like large dolls, which makes sense as they were bodies with a soul grafted on them. On the other hand, many end up being taken care of by an adult, who worries about a child wandering around alone. In particular, Triclops are noted for having a special liking of these ageless children.</p> <p>Average Height: 3’3” (99 cm) Average Weight: 40 pounds (18 kg) Life Span: Ageless. Interesting Traits: Though unable to breed; Chou-jin have different sexes. Most look like Russian dolls.</p> <p>Example: Chiaotzu.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Stat</th> <th style="text-align: center">Base</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Int</td> <td style="text-align: center">18</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Mnt</td> <td style="text-align: center">20</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Str</td> <td style="text-align: center">8</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Dex</td> <td style="text-align: center">8</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Stm</td> <td style="text-align: center">9</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Spd</td> <td style="text-align: center">12</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <p>Distribute 27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat.<br><br> HP: 8 x STM + 10 x Level<br> Ki: 15 x MNT + 30 x Level<br> LP: 15 x STM<br><br> HP Mod Increase at: 4, 8, 12, etc.<br> Ki Mod Increase at: 6, 12, 18, etc.<br><br> Every Level-up, Chou-jin gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic +1 to all Stats.<br><br> At Level 1, pick six powers.<br> Every Level-up, gain two powers.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><br><br></p> <h4 id="--racial-features--">-=( Racial Features )=-<br><br> </h4> <ul> <li> <p>(Phys) Due to their small size, Chou-jin always have +4 to Dodge rolls.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Phys) Chou-jin start with the Basic Flight power and do not have to pay Ki to use it.

Chou-jin gain a bonus to all Strike and Dodge rolls according to the form of Flight they’re using: <br></p> </li> </ul> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Flight Power</th> <th style="text-align: center">Bonus</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Basic Flight</td> <td style="text-align: center">+1 to all Strike and Dodge rolls.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Advanced Flight</td> <td style="text-align: center">+2 to all Strike and Dodge rolls.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Boosted Flight</td> <td style="text-align: center">+3 to all Strike and Dodge rolls.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><br></p> <ul> <li> <p>(Ment) Chou-jin are physically weak, but make up for it with mental prowess. All of a Chou-jin’s Ki attacks can gain +10 Damage per 100 Max Ki that they have available (Charging does not increase this damage). Whenever an attack is enhanced with this bonus, declare it and pay your Levelx15 additional Ki, which does not count towards ‘Enlarged Ki Blast’. Apply this damage at the end of your damage, like Bulk - it’s not multiplied by anything. Template: ((Max Ki x10)/100). Alternatively, you may decide not to pay a Ki cost and add ((Max Ki x6)/100) damage instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Ment) Chou-jins start with a Regular School of their choice at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another school, this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning future schools. Schools gained in this way grant double the normal stat bonus.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="--racial-powers--">-=( Racial Powers )=-</h4> <ul> <li> <p>(Ment) ‘Improved ESP’ - The Chou-jin must have the ‘Minor ESP’ power before taking this power. With this, the Chou-jin can communicate for no Ki cost across any distance with anyone they have ever come in contact with, as if they have sensed the target. ‘Improved ESP’ is two-way: If you contact someone, they can respond to you even if they do not have this power or without sensing you.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Ment) ‘Mental Barrier’ - This power is automatically obtained at Level 5. The Chou-jin are able to tap in to their Ki and manipulate it to grant a constant form of protection. This gives a Resistance value based on your MNT/4. Stacking with other forms of Resistance.</p> </li> </ul> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="hr2">Ligon</h2> <p>Ligons are a small, green-skinned people with four eyes. They are renowned for both their ability to manipulate time and their unrelenting refusal to provide any details about their home world, Ligon. This paranoia is so widespread that it often follows Ligons to other planets they live on, such is the case of Liquius where even the humans and reptiles on the planet feel the same paranoia about world visitors. Though one would be wise not to say this to them, Ligon are very much distant relatives to frogs. Though they are humanoid, they are amphibians, not mammals.</p> <p>When Ligons evolve from tadpoles, they are very similar to baby humans (save for the extra eyes and green skin!). There, they begin to learn to walk and adjust to living bipedal lives. Despite being amphibians, Ligons have a strict sense of honor and religious duty as well as mate for life. Furthermore, finding a Ligon that is not deeply devoted to the Kaioshins is especially rare, even for those who grew up outside of the cultural boundaries of Ligon and Liquius.</p> <p>Average Height: 3’5” (104 cm) Average Weight: 80 pounds (36 kg) Life Span: 70-90 years. Interesting Traits: Frog-like creatures, four eyes, green skin.</p> <p>Example: Guldo.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Stat</th> <th style="text-align: center">Base</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Int</td> <td style="text-align: center">18</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Mnt</td> <td style="text-align: center">16</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Str</td> <td style="text-align: center">8</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Dex</td> <td style="text-align: center">10</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Stm</td> <td style="text-align: center">12</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Spd</td> <td style="text-align: center">10</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <p>Distribute 27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat.<br><br> HP: 11 x STM + 20 x Level<br> Ki: 12 x MNT + 20 x Level<br> LP: 15 x STM<br><br> HP Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc.<br> Ki Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc.<br><br> Every Level-up, Ligons gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic +1 to all stats.<br><br> At Level 1, pick Six powers.<br> Every Level-up, gain two powers.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><br><br></p> <h4 id="--racial-features---1">-=( Racial Features )=-<br><br> </h4> <ul> <li> <p>(Ment) Ligons have an unusual mastery of Ki, gaining Max Ki/25 damage to Ki attacks (Charging does not affect this).</p> </li> <li> <p>(Phys) The Ligon’s secondary pair of eyes gives them an advantage in combat; providing them with a +2 to all Strike and Dodge rolls and immunity to the ‘Zanzoken’ power. If a Ligon is blinded by ‘Taiyoken’ power (or something similarly blinding), the Ligon loses these bonuses for the rest of the round.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Ment) Ligons are immune to their own type of ‘Mind Freeze’.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Phys) Due to their small size, Ligon always have +4 to Dodge rolls.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Ment) Ligons start with a Regular School of their choice at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and 20.

Schools gained in this way grant double the normal stat bonus.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="--racial-powers---1">-=( Racial Powers )=-</h4> <p>Both of these powers are considered Telekinetic powers and as such Super Speeds cannot be used with or against these powers.</p> <ul> <li> <p>(Ment) ‘Time Freeze’ - The Ligon must be Level 2 before taking this power. Three times per round, a Ligon can hold their breath to slow down time, during which only they can move. In combat, everyone else is frozen in stasis and unable to even perceive the world around them. It’s simply a blank until the Ligon allows time to resume. The Ligon may use this power after a failed Dodge or Parry to give themselves enough time to Block, Power Block, or Advanced Block instead. This costs 3 End per use. By spending two Round uses of this power, this allows a Ligon to take up to their Levelx2 Actions as a single Action, as long as none of those extra actions have any direct impact on an opponent or attended objects. This means that all attacks are out, but things like Charging (even charging into an attack!) is okay. The Ligon can charge, use items that do not affect another person, pick up unattended items or similar actions. The Ligon must spend 3 END per extra action taken, in addition to any normal costs they might need to pay. Since time does not actually pass, no Regen occurs during these “extra” actions. “They, also, do not count towards the duration of power and effects.” WUT</p> </li> <li> <p>(Ment) ‘Mind Freeze’ - The Ligon must have the ‘Time Freeze’ power and be Level 4, before taking this power. Usable once per round, a Ligon may focus their time-warping abilities on an opponent’s mind and body, rendering them unable to move at all–even to defend themselves! This is resolved as a Telekinetic attack against all opponents, costing 10% of the Ligon’s Current Ki (including any Charging Ki Pools and Megacharge Ki Pools!) and 3 End. It has a -6 Strike Penalty and the Ligon must roll separately against each target they want to ‘Mind Freeze’. Temporary bonuses to strike (such as Focused, for example) must be paid for separately for each strike roll. If it hits, the target becomes “Time Locked.” While Time Locked, the victim can do nothing but roll (40+(Their MNT or STR)/5 - (The Ligon’s MNT)/5 - 1d100). On a 0 or higher; they break free of the psychokinetic hold and may act normally on their next action. On a -1 or lower, the Ligon may pay 10% of their current Ki and 3 END to keep them Time Locked until their next action. This can last up to a maximum of the Ligon’s 2+(Level/4) consecutive actions.</p> <p>While someone who is Time Locked is unable to defend themselves, any attacks aimed at them become Locked as well. The attack is held in suspended animation mere inches from the target. When the Time Lock ends (either because its duration elapses, the Ligon chooses not to pay or because the victim broke free), the pending attacks are resolved with no defense or reflexive actions, except the use of Auras and Shields. After all reductions, any attacks that deal damage only deal 20% initially. For every Action the Victim takes after, they continue to take 20% until 100% of the damage has been recieved. Attacks that don’t deal damage are simply negated against someone Time Locked. Als, the level of all incoming Critical Hits are reduced by one category (AC is negated). If the Ligon using this power is killed or rendered unconscious while they have a victim Time Locked, then not only does the Lock end but all attacks against the victim automatically fail.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="hr3">Martial Artist</h2> <p>Martial Artists are the elite of their kind, who have taken the martial arts to incredible levels. Whereas, most races have a basic understanding of Ki from birth, humans have to work to grasp even the smallest understanding of it. However, those that do are known to be just as strong as the strongest warriors from races born with the most intricate knowledge of the arts. As such, these humans are renowned for their mastery of Ki and special martial arts schools. Many are sought out to be learned from.<br><br> Furthermore, humans are the most populous race in the universe. Having been one of the first races to develop intergalactic travel, their numbers spread across the universe. It is rare to find a world not inhabited by humans. Even stranger is the fact that some planets, such as Bayushi, were already populated by humans for generations before anyone from Earth stepped foot on it. Perhaps, there is something special about what caused the evolution of humans, which causes it to reproduce itself so often elsewhere?<br><br> Average Height: 5’10” (177 cm)<br> Average Weight: 180 pounds (81 kg)<br> Life Span: 60-80 years.<br> Interesting Traits: Especially resilient, Adaptable.<br><br> Example: Krillin (Kuririn).<br></p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Stat</th> <th style="text-align: center">Base</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Int</td> <td style="text-align: center">16</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Mnt</td> <td style="text-align: center">16</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Str</td> <td style="text-align: center">10</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Dex</td> <td style="text-align: center">11</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Stm</td> <td style="text-align: center">12</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Spd</td> <td style="text-align: center">10</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <p>Distribute 27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat.<br><br> HP: 10 x STM + 15 x Level<br> Ki: 13 x MNT + 25 x Level<br> LP: 15 x STM<br><br> HP Mod Increase at: 4, 8, 12, etc.<br> Ki Mod Increase at: 6, 12, 18, etc.<br><br> Every Level-up, Martial Artists gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br><br> At Level 1, pick six powers. <br> Every Level-up, gain two powers.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><br></p> <h4 id="--racial-features---2">-=( Racial Features )=-<br><br> </h4> <ul> <li>(Ment) Martial Artists have Ki Regen equal to Levelx5.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) If a Martial Artist fires a Discharge (or any improved version of it) for half or less of its Ki cost, it is instead free. Addons are still paid for seperately.<br><br> </li> <li>(Phys) ‘Martial Artist Aura’<br>When you declare the use of this ability with a power, it allows you to pay Ki costs by ‘spending’ your HP instead. or you can use it as a defensive Aura: <ul> <li>This Aura costs 1 Ki for every 1 damage and is SP Resistant and may be used Reflexively. There is no limit to the amount of Ki that may be spent. Unlike other Auras, this may be used multiple times against Combo attacks. HP may not be used to fuel this Martial Artist Aura.</li> <li>This does not mean Martial Artists can freely swap HP and Ki.</li> <li>The cost of this ability can never be reduced by more than 50% with suppression; even at 90% suppression.<br><br> </li> </ul> </li> <li>(Ment) Martial Artists start with a Regular School of their choice at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another school, this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning future schools. Schools gained in this way grant double the normal stat bonus. Martial Artists can not know more than one school for every 8 points of INT.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) Truly experienced Martial Artists are great at mixing everything they have learned into a big pot of techniques that can be molded into their own, growing school. At Level 7; a Martial Artist can submit a ‘Player Created School’ to the GMs, as if they’d possessed it from Level 1. Simply having the School doesn’t make people want it, though and as the Martial Artist improves, so does its fame. At Level 12; the Martial Artist can then teach their school to up to two other player characters. This training takes 2 Neo Weeks. During this time, neither player is allowed to fight or EXP train.<br><br> </li> </ul> <h4 id="--racial-powers---2">-=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br> </h4> <ul> <li>(Ment) ‘Trained’ - This power is automatically obtained at Level 1.<br>A Martial Artist chooses one of the powers granted to them by their first Regular School’s power list; that power is considered to be three levels higher than it actually is. If you already have a power and gain a higher level as a result, they can’t choose that power to be Trained. The School’s Invent can be chosen.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) ‘Supreme Shield’ - The Martial Artist must be Level 5 before taking this power.<br>The Martial Artist can now use his ‘Martial Artist Aura’ to block one Unpreventable attack per round, at the cost of 1 Ki per 1 damage. There is no limit to the amount of Ki that can be spent. This ability counts as a reflexive shield, like his normal Martial Artist Aura. Suppress Powerlevel does not reduce the costs of this shield.</li> </ul> <h2 id="hr4">Triclops</h2> <p>Evolution is an odd thing, changing one race ever so slightly. After years and years of being the top of the food chain on Earth, Humans took a turn in the evolutionary circle. Unlike their advanced human counterparts (Martial Artists), they do not have a great grasp on harnessing their Ki. Instead, they are more physically powerful. Not only are they stronger in the ways of hand to hand combat, they are rather adept at separating techniques, able to split into as many as four separate beings. Above all, they have evolved a beneficial third eye, allowing them to see better than most other races. Unfortunately, though, they seem to have lost the ability to grow hair, as their bodies are very efficient at processing ‘waste’.<br><br> Average Height: 6’3” (190 cm)<br> Average Weight: 250 pounds (113 kg)<br> Life Span: 120-150 years.<br> Interesting Traits: Three eyes, bald.<br><br> Example: Tien (Tienshinhan).<br></p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Stat</th> <th style="text-align: left">Base</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Int</td> <td style="text-align: left">16</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Mnt</td> <td style="text-align: left">11</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Str</td> <td style="text-align: left">13</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Dex</td> <td style="text-align: left">11</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Stm</td> <td style="text-align: left">14</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Spd</td> <td style="text-align: left">10</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <p>Distribute 27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat.<br><br> HP: 11 x STM + 25 x Level<br> Ki: 12 x MNT + 15 x Level<br> LP: 15 x STM<br><br> HP Mod Increase at: 4, 8, 12, etc.<br> Ki Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc.<br><br> Every Level-up, Triclops gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br><br> At Level 1, pick six powers. <br> Every Level-up, gain two powers. <br><br></p> </blockquote> <h4 id="--racial-features---3">-=( Racial Features )=-<br><br> </h4> <ul> <li>(Phys) The third eye of a Triclops gives them an advantage in combat, granting +1 to all Strike and Dodge rolls and immunity to the ‘Zanzoken’ power. If a Triclops is blinded by ‘Taiyoken’ or a similar blinding power, the Triclops loses these bonuses for the rest of the round.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) Triclops have an unusual mastery of Ki, granting Max Ki/25 damage to Hand-to-Hand and Sword attacks (Charging does not affect this).<br><br> </li> <li>(Phys) Triclops are capable of pushing their body to the absolute brink of exhaustion and beyond. They have STMx1.5 END. But more impressively, reaching 0 or less END on their own turn, does not cause a Triclops to pass out. Instead, at the end of their turn; they are brought up to 1 END remaining. Splitform/Trifork/Quadform de-activates. They, then, take 20% of their Maximum HP in unpreventable damage. If they drop to 0 or less END outside of their own turn (for instance, from being Choked), they pass out normally.<br><br> </li> <li>(Phys) Triclops are known for rapidly recovering from almost any injury. They Regen Levelx2 HP, or Levelx1 LP. They also heal from serious injuries at a rapid rate; halved if they also have the Immortal Unique:</li> <li>AC Broken Bone: 3 RL Hours.</li> <li>DAC Broken Bone: 12 RL Hours.</li> <li>TAC Broken Bone or Removed Limb: 24 RL Hours.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) At Level 12, a Triclops is able to pass on the knowledge of their signature move to other people. Although, the result is less stable than for a Triclops. You may teach up to two students ‘SplitForm’ or a single student ‘SplitForm’ and ‘Trifork’. The training takes 2 Neo Weeks to learn. During this time, neither player is allowed to fight.</li> <li>When a non-Triclops uses Splitform or Trifork, their Split is destroyed after receiving 25% of their Maximum HP as damage and they may only make Splits while above 75% HP. These Splits may not inflict Critical Effects, but the Attack still becomes AP/SP and Stuns as normal.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) Triclops start with a Regular School of their choice at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another school, this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning future schools. Schools gained in this way grant double the normal stat bonus. Triclops can not know more than one school for every 9 points of INT.</li> </ul> <h4 id="--racial-powers---3">-=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br> </h4> <ul> <li>(Phys) ‘Splitform’ - This power is automatically obtained at Level 1.<br> This power may be used to split into multiple forms or multiple arms! You may activate or deactivate this power as an Action, or as a Pre-Round Action. When it is first learned you may only seperate into two Splits. Dividing your power between multiple bodies is taxing in focus and energy. You lose 2 END per Split beyond the first, per action this Power is active and you lose 1 APR per Split while this Power is active. In return, you gain the following benefits:</li> <li>During your Actions, you and each of your Splits may take an action.</li> <li>Splits are targeted separately. This means that debuffs, such as stunning, Grappling or Capture Ball, only apply to the Split they targeted. Each Splitform</li> <li>Buffs, such as ‘Ki Enhance’ or ‘Shield Piercing Charge’ are applied to all Splits.</li> <li>Although not a Superform, while active this power suppresses the benefits of all Superforms; including Permanent Superforms.</li> <li>You and your Splits share all pools (HP, Ki, END, Ki Shield, available Tactician Bonus, etc). If any of these pools have Regen, you only Regen once as normal.</li> <li>When using an Action in the fight to create or dismiss this technique; ALL actions on that single APR are used consumed. This means you cannot split, take additional actions and reform to reacquire extra actions.</li> <li>Splits share all Uses Per Round; with the exception of non-Super Speed Type 2 powers, with one use per Action, per Split.</li> <li>Each Split may benefit from Bulk &amp; PKU, but must pay for it separately per Attack.</li> <li>Non-Custom Items &amp; Equipment are replicated between splits, but if the item is consumable or can be damaged, then its use applies to all Splits. Custom items &amp; Equipment are simply unique.</li> <li>Splits must remain within 100 yards of each other. If one is in combat, they are all in combat.</li> <li>If multiple Splits attack on the same APR, then all attacks are declared and resolved at the same time. Apply the effects of all attacks at the end of the action at the same time. Functioning like a Multi Slash. Make a separate Strike and Damage roll for each attack. Superspeeds used to assist and defend against the attacks apply equally to all of the Triclop’s attacks for that APR as normal.</li> <li> <p>Superspeeds, the Focused feature, Shadowform, and other things with an X/Round, X/2 Rounds or X/Battle limitation only apply its benefits to one Split when used. The others, instead, automatically benefit from ‘Advanced Combat Teleport’ for free for that Action.</p> </li> <li>After Reforming, all Critical Effects and other Status Effects are applied to the reformed whole. Status Effects or Critical Effects do not stack. i.e. If both splits have a broken arm, the reformed Triclops only has one broken arm, not two.</li> <li>When activating Split-Form, all Splits retain any status effects already afflicting the Triclops.</li> <li>You may not activate Split-Form while Grappling or being Grappled, including Racial Powers that function like a Grapple. However, you may maintain Split-Form after being Grappled or later begin a Grapple while in Split-Form.</li> <li>You select which Split remains as the “real” one when reforming (through damage or choice). This may get you out of certain location-based status effects such as Grapples and ‘Capture Ball’.</li> <li>When initiating a grapple, any number of Splits may grapple the same person if you are successful (and the Split has not used his/her action). When doing this, no one else besides the Triclops may also grapple them. When multiple Splits are grappling one person, they count as only one individual with +15% STR per Split (+30% with two, +45% with three, +60% with four) in the grapple for Grapple-only powers, Break checks, and Shift checks. Only one Split-Form may perform an action while this is being maintained, as all the other Split-Forms are busy helping. If you make use of a move that breaks the Grapple; it ends immediately for all Splits involved.</li> <li>When firing a Ki attack at a Triclops involved in a grapple as above; you do not count the Triclops as multiple targets.</li> <li>Any single attack that deals more than 50% of a Split’s Current HP causes that Split to Reform, even Mid-Combo. This causes the Triclops’ number of Splits to be reduced by 1 and ends the power if there is only one Split left.</li> <li> <p>When a Split is destroyed, the Triclops has a minimum of 1 HP.<br><br></p> </li> <li> <p>(Ment) ‘Shin-Ki-Ko-Ho Blast’ - The Triclops must be Level 2 before taking this power.<br> This is a technique primarily meant to hold opponents back. The Triclops forms a Rhombus with his hands and releases a ray of energy that Stuns anything it damages. This is a Ki attack with a +5 bonus to Strike, which can be used an unlimited number of times per round, but only once per APR. It deals 1d6x10 damage plus 1d6x10 per additional level and is Armor Piercing and Shield Piercing. If someone is damaged by the Blast, they are stunned. This attack costs 15 Ki per level and 7 END.<br><br>Template: (1d6x10xLevel + Mnt Mod + Misc Mod ) x Multiplier (if applicable) + PKU . SP/AP/Stun</p> </li> <li>(Phys) ‘Trifork’ - The Triclops must be Level 3 before taking this power.<br> While you have 50% of your maximum HP or more, you may Split into three bodies using ‘Splitform’. However, you may not inflict Critical Effects while you have three or more Splits active. A critical roll will still make the attack AP/SP/Stun as normal. You may maintain multiple splits while below 50% HP, you just can’t make them.<br><br> </li> <li>(Phys) ‘Quad-Form’ - The Triclops must be Level 4 before taking this power.<br> While you have 75% of your maximum HP or more, you may Split into four bodies using ‘Splitform’. However, you may not inflict Critical Effects while you have three or more Splits active. A critical roll will still make the attack AP/SP/Stun as normal. You may maintain multiple splits while below 75% HP, you just can’t make them.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) ‘Teamwork’ - This power is automatically obtained at Level 5.<br> Your Splits become significantly better at using group tactics to take opponents down together. You’ve become immune to area of effect attacks from your own Splits, such as the power ‘Taiyoken’. If multiple Splits attack the same person at the same time; their DEX and MNT are increased by 5% for each Split attacking for purposes of strike rolls only (+10% with two, +15% with three, +20% with four).</li> </ul> <h2 id="hr5">Tsufuru-Jin</h2> <p>The Tsufuru-jin (also referred to as a Tuffle) are a frail, yet highly intelligent native of the Planet Plant. They protected their domain from the chaotic race of wilderness-dwelling Saiyans, but ultimately lost the battle and were forced off their own homeworld, now renamed Vegeta. Their civilization was heavily advanced and possessed technology that allows them to move spaceships beyond the speed of light, which is where they now live - in the cold depths of space. They appear to be naturally adept with using all forms of technology beyond the normal means of most races, which has given them an edge at survival that few would be able to achieve in such harsh conditions. They are not a particularly vengeful race. However, they might harbor ill-will or distrust towards Saiyans.<br><br> Average Height: 5’9” (175 cm)<br> Average Weight: 160 pounds (72 kg)<br> Life Span: 250-300 years.<br> Interesting Traits: Craftsman, technologically advanced.<br><br> Example: Tuffle King, Dr. Raichi.<br></p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Stat</th> <th style="text-align: left">Base</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Int</td> <td style="text-align: left">25</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Mnt</td> <td style="text-align: left">13</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Str</td> <td style="text-align: left">9</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Dex</td> <td style="text-align: left">9</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Stm</td> <td style="text-align: left">10</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Spd</td> <td style="text-align: left">9</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <p>Distribute 27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat<br><br> HP: 8 x STM + 10 x Level<br> Ki: 8 x MNT + 15 x Level<br> LP: 14 x STM<br><br> HP Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc.<br> Ki Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc.<br><br> Every Level-up, Tusufuru-jin gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br><br> At Level 1, pick six powers. <br> Every Level-up, gain two powers.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="--racial-features---4">-=( Racial Features )=-<br><br> </h4> <ul> <li>(Ment) Tsufuru-jin may not be the the physically strongest or forceful of races, but they are apt in finding the weaknesses of their supposed superiors. Tuffles may use INT/4 as their damage modifier for all attacks. When using their blaster, they must use INT/4 as their damage modifier.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) Tsufuru-jin are capable of rapidly mastering new skills. Every time they level up, they gain 1 additional power, following the normal rules for gaining powers every level.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) Tsufuru-jin rely on advanced weaponry to make up for their, otherwise, weak attacks. Tuffles carry around “Blasters” and other weaponry capable of harming mighty foes. Metal ammunition functions as a Racial Sword that deals 4d10 AP damage per level and becomes AS at Level 11. It, also, has a ‘Powercell’ pool of 6 Energy. By consuming one energy, you may fire a Ki Offense power through the Blaster. Using a power in this way does not cost Ki; but you must still pay for the cost of any addons. Multi or Combo powers costs 2 Energy, +1 Energy per attack in the combo. When you use your Blaster to fire Ki attacks; you instead use your DEX mod for your strike roll and gain +Level/2 bonus to Strike. You may not fire Invents, powers gained through the Ki Fighting Style, or any other attack that is not a “Ki Offense Power” through your blaster.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) Tsufuru-jin are some of the most apt craftsmen in the universe. They may learn ‘Recipes, as though they were powers. Recipes allow them to craft items by spending a certain amount of credits and Neo Weeks spent crafting. You may only craft one item at a time. But, crafting does not interfere with training or fighting.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) Tsufuru-jin start with a regular school of their choice at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15 and 20.

This shield costs no Ki and stops up to Levelx50+INT/2 damage, or half in SP damage. At Level 5, this shield stops an additional INT/2 damage from SP and non-SP attacks. This shield may be used an unlimited number of times per round, but only once per combo.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) ‘Arms and Armor Crafting’ - This power may be obtained at Level 1.<br> You may craft or repair Weapons or Armor of any type. This costs half of the normal amount of credits than to buy and takes 1 Neo Week for a weapon or 1 Neo Week per Rank for Armor to complete. Repairing Armor takes half of the time and credits of building a new one.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) ‘Basic Gear Crafting’ - This power may be obtained at Level 1.<br> You may craft Scouters, Dragon Ball Radars, Trinkets, Spacesuits, Spacesuit Repair Kits and Weighted Clothing. This costs half of the normal amount of credits than to buy and takes 2 Neo Weeks.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) Rejuvenator Crafting - This power may be obtained at Level 1.<br> You may craft Rejuvenators and their special equipment that allows for warriors to rapidly heal. This costs an amount of credits and time spent crafting it, as detailed below and it must be in a Dwelling. While crafting a Rejuvenator, you may not craft anything else, but may fight and train normally.</li> <li>Basic Model: Restores +10% HP and Ki per Neo Hour and doubles LP recovery.

This costs 300 Credits and 1 Neo Week spent crafting.</li> <li>You may improve a weapon’s basic design. Basic attacks and the ‘Slice’ power deal +20% base damage. This costs 300 Credits and 1 Neo Week spent crafting.</li> <li>Dragon Ball Radars made by you have a +15% chance to find the Dragon Balls.<br><br> </li> <li>(Ment) ‘Operation’ - The Tsufuru-jin must be Level 5 before taking this power.<br>Okay, look. When something is broken, you don’t duct tape it up and hope it fixes itself… Maybe, you do. But, Tsufuru-jin know that replacement is always more effective (and fun) than letting it heal over time. A Tsufuru-jin may take up to one person under their “care” and in a single Neo week–using surgery and robotics to repair Critical hits. The results are usually significantly shinier and more obvious than the patient expected. But, few can argue with the results. The Tsufuru-jin can’t spend that Neo week crafting (potentially delaying existing projects by 1 Neo Week), but is otherwise not occupied. The person taken under care must spend a certain amount of time recovering from the surgery. During which time, they may not fight. A Tsufuru-jin may work on themselves.</li> <li>AC Broken Bone: 3 RL Hours.</li> <li>DAC Broken Bone: 12 RL Hours.</li> <li>TAC Broken Bone or Removed Limb: 24 RL Hours.</li> </ul> <h2 id="hr6">Yardrat</h2> <p>The Yardrats are an alien race, who live a few light years away from planet Namek. While their planet seems to be without excess, their style of clothing emulates gluttony. Often, their outfits are lavish with ruffles and belts. Any variation of the style is acceptable based on social standing. However, deviation from the basic idea of the most popular fashion will often get a Yardrat discriminated against by his peers. Damaging a Yardrat’s clothes may be perceived as a huge sign of disrespect.<br><br> Physically, they never stand more than four feet tall, and never weigh more than seventy pounds. They, also, only come in one color: pink! Their bodies are small in comparison to their skull, which balloons above their large, round, yellow eyes like a globe, spotted with purple along the top center. These purple spots can differ in variation. But, by no means are they a reliable way of differentiating one Yardrat from another. They only have four fingers on either hand, and four toes on each foot. Yardrat do not have hair anywhere on their bodies. This includes a distinct lack of eyebrows. Androgyny is the name of the game if you are a Yardrat. It is speculated that they reproduce by growing their young in test tubes, created from an amalgamation of their DNA and other Yardrat DNA. They are born with the knowledge of each DNA donor. Thus, they are able to enter society almost immediately after being born.<br><br> As a species, the Yardrat have proven to be nice to outsiders, welcoming the rare few who find their planet, and are curious of them. It is not in a Yardrat to deny the opportunity for gaining knowledge. They are, also, eager to share their knowledge and ability concerning the manipulation of time and space, if they see it to be helpful to someone outside of their own race. Their society is a perfect picture of unity. And, it is very rare for one Yardrat to turn down another who may need help.<br><br> Height: 3-4’ (Max) (91-121 cm)<br> Weight: 60 - 70 pounds (27-31 kg)<br> Life Span: 200-300 years. Age can be relatively determined by the amount of wrinkles on a Yardrat’s face.<br> Interesting Traits: When living in large groups, Yardrats are thought to follow a hive-mind mentality. Only a few Yardrats ever speak.<br><br> Example: The Anime series did not single out a Yardrat. However, they are shown en masse, clustering around Goku’s crashed space pod. They nurse him back to health, repair his ship, and teach him the Instant Transmission technique before sending him back home. He has no complaints about the species and seems rather fond of them in his recollection.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Stat</th> <th style="text-align: left">Base</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Int</td> <td style="text-align: left">18</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Mnt</td> <td style="text-align: left">20</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Str</td> <td style="text-align: left">7</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Dex</td> <td style="text-align: left">10</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Stm</td> <td style="text-align: left">10</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Spd</td> <td style="text-align: left">14</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <p>Distribute 27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat.<br><br> HP: 8 x STM + 10 x Level<br> Ki: 15 x MNT + 30 x Level<br> LP: 15 x STM<br><br> HP Mod Increase at: 4, 8, 12, etc.<br> Ki Mod Increase at: 6, 12, 18, etc.<br><br> Every Level-up, Yardrats gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br><br> At Level 1, pick six powers. <br> Every Level-up, gain two powers.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="--racial-features---5">-=( Racial Features )=-<br><br> </h4> <ul> <li>(Ment) Yardrats have a natural talent to slightly warp space and time, making them appear faster than they really are in reality.

When used in battle; it gives a MNT/5 bonus to a Strike or Dodge roll, replacing other Superspeeds. It costs 150 Ki and 3 End to use and can only be used once every two rounds. By touching them, one other person may be brought with the Yardrat (usually, this means they are in a grapple) and by paying an additional 150 Ki and 3 End. Used in this way, this lets the Yardrat dodge an attack originating from outside a grapple and/or allows them to help other people escape (see IT Escape). The other person need not be willing, but they do get a Grapple Break attempt (even Flare Break) to prevent it if they choose.<br> When the Yardrat reaches Level 12, they can teach this power to a single person, who must be at least Level 8. Teaching this power takes two Neo weeks. During which time, neither person may fight or train. The person taught this technique can not teach it to anyone.</li> </ul> <h5 id="it-escape">IT Escape<br> </h5> <p>Before a battle has started, if someone attacks you (‘calls init’); you can not teleport away to avoid combat altogether. When you wish to leave a scene in this manner, declare you’re doing so and check that no one intends to stop you. If they do wish to stop or attack you, Initiative is rolled as normal. On the first action you get, you may attempt to teleport away, declaring it. Anyone, who wishes to attack you, may make any basic attack or basic discharge, with add-ons as normal, against your single Dodge with your bonus from IT.<br><br> If you dodge their attack, you successfully leave the scene. If they hit you, you have failed to escape and take damage; even if you reduce that damage to zero, you fail to teleport. It must be your action to teleport away. If you teleport and the person that you are fighting is also capable of teleporting with Kai Kai/IT, they may follow you as a pursuit.<br><br> Failure to teleport away from combat still costs the power’s normal amount of Ki and End.<br><br> Note: If you use Freeze or Temporal Distortion; it still only allows you to avoid a single attack, not all attacks from multiple opponents.</p> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2025 You R.
