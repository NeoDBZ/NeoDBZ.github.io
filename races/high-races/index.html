mt-5" role="main"> <ol> <li>Initiative When two people square off, there’s a clash of timing to be decided</li> </ol> <p>The first thing you do when combat begins and start a ‘Round’, is roll your Initiative to determine the order of your actions and have your APR value handy; both will be on your sheet. Your initiative roller may vary by Uniques or other modifiers; but the basics remain the same:</p> <p>Init: 1d20+(Int/5+Spd/25)</p> <p>APR: INT/30+DEX/35+SPD/25</p> <p>The person who rolled highest, goes first. But, first take the number and divide it by your Actions Per Round (APR). This will give you your order of Actions for the coming fight. If you rolled an Init of 21 with 3 APR (difference of 7) and your Opponent rolled 20, with 4 APR; it would look something like this:</p> <p>Y OO Y O Y O</p> <p>Since you rolled 21, your first Action is first. And a difference of 7 gives 21, 14, 7. 20 divided by 4 APR gives a difference of 5; 20, 15, 10 and 5. This becomes more complex as you have more fighters, more APR and certain Uniques that can make active changes. But for now, we go into the pre-Round.</p> <p>Some Powers, Features, Equipment and Superforms allow you to use them during this pre-Round phase and this is when you declare them (Weighted Clothes, Attempting a Ki-Lock or Basic Flight being all being good examples). Once declared, pay any costs owed. Traditionally this is where two fighters are sizing one another up or smack-talking, before the fists fly. More info on declarations and roleplay, the better.</p> <p>To reduce back and forth in this phase; you’re free to list your Powerlevel &amp; Path; even if your opponent was not successful in locking on - ensure they are aware of any complications, so they do not mistakenly include bonuses they shouldn’t have. Rule of thumb is anything that provides important information to your opponent, so they don’t have to ask, speeds things up. An example format can look like:</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Initiative: 21</td> <td>APR: 3</td> <td>SPD: 28</td> <td>Declaring: Basic Flight. Weighted Clothes 1. Ki Sense: Auto. Neutral Good. PL 150. EA Blocking Lock.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Your Speed stat is listed to break ties on the event of rolling the same value. Once everyone has run out of actions, a whole minute has passed and a new Round begins with a fresh Init roll.</p> <p>Remember, your APR stats are a minimum of 1 per stat; if your INT is 20, 20/30 = 1. Your minimum final APR is also 3; so Uniques or Superforms cannot reduce them below this.</p> <ol> <li>Actions Actions are defined seperately of APR; an Action is something that consumes your APR in the Round’s order. ‘Immediate’ effects do not use an Action, applying when circumstance dictates. When taking your Action, it’s important that you Roleplay out what you’re doing descriptively, followed by a brief Out Of Character explanation of what you’re doing. For example:</li> </ol> <p>Arvok smirks, his aura flaring slightly as he does so. Seconds pass, and his aura begins to grow massively, collecting ki at an alarming rate! When his aura dims, his powerlevel has grown substantially. (Megacharge)</p> <p>In the above, Arvok roleplayed his action and declared what power he was doing. You must declare what you’re using.</p> <p>Everyone has access to ‘Basic Attacks’ and you have Powers you’ve hopefully unlocked that also use Actions to perform.</p> <p>All Actions cost 1 point of END, unless they state they do not cost END. Anything costing more will say as such.</p> <p>Attacking your opponent is as simple as roleplay, declaration and waiting for the Defender, who in response to being Attacked; chooses a defense, submits a roleplay and declares what defense they’ve selected. The most common methods being Blocking (let them hit you, but reduce the impact depending on which Block Power you use) and Dodging (attempt to evade damage completely). Defenses are not considered Actions and thus do not natively have an END cost, unless their Power specifically sets one: Parrying Powers (functionally similar to Dodging, but redirecting their attack away with your hands or a weapon) have an associated END cost for example and cannot be used before its power is bought.</p> <p>To attack; the template would be: 1d20 + StrikeMod + Misc + Superspeeds Likewise, Active Defense would be: 1d20 + DefMod + Misc + Superspeeds</p> <p>As part of your Action and Defenses; you can also Declare Addons such as Superspeeds and Bulks. Once both Attacker and Defender have declared; rolls are made.</p> <p>Some Powers/Uniques/Features allow rerolls or other abilities after rolls are resolved. Zanzoken or Freeze are good examples of this.</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <ol> <li>Damage &amp; Reduction We understand how to determine our combat order, taking Actions and Defenses. Now to actually get to beating them to a pulp. Each Attack / Power will have a Damage ‘Template’ associated with it. Broadly, it will follow this format</li> </ol> <p>Template: ( Dice per Level + Statmod/5 + Misc Mods ) x Multipliers + Bulk or PKU</p> <p>But variety is the spice of life. For example, the Unique Final Ki Attacker’s multiplier doesn’t work on Misc Mods. So, any variation to this basic template will tell you.</p> <p>Goku rolled and ended up dealing 384 points of AP/SP damage to Vegeta with his Power Punch, whom failed a parry. Vegeta is level 6, so he decides to use the Power Supreme Aura to reduce the damage by 150; the maximium the Power allows for his level. He then shows his damage calculation as:</p> <p>384-150 = 234</p> <p>Damage Reduction will almost always follow the same format;</p> <p>( Damage - Auras/Shields ) Divided by block - Resistance.</p> <p>Had Vegeta any Resistance or if he’d Blocked, he would’ve taken less damage or saved 150 Ki. Or maybe he should start wearing Armor.</p> <p>Once Damage Reduction is resolved, both Attacker and Defender pay any costs they owe, mark the damage has HP lost and then it moves onto the next Action in the Round.</p> <p>Damage Reduction is always shown publically for transparency and to represent your opponent learning how to adapt in the fight. Do not be offended if your Opponent is unsure what you’ve used or want a breakdown step-by-step.</p> <p>This exchange came out in Goku’s favour; both in End paid (1 vs 2 for Parry), Ki paid (30 vs 180 for ACT + Aura) and HP; which means if they kept up this kind of exchange, Goku could win.</p> <p>Now you know the basics of combat; Rolling Initiative, working out Combat order, Basic Attacks, Actions, Defenses, Damage and Reduction. You can effectively start playing right away. However, there are more advanced Powers, Abilities, Status Effects and more if you want to compete to be the best.</p> <ol> <li>Changing up Attacks There’s four ways of attacking someone:</li> </ol> <p>Hand to Hand (H2H) Attacks, Sword or Weapon Attacks, Ki Attack and Telekinetic (TK) Attacks. In every case, every attack can be placed into one of these categories.</p> <p>H2H Attacks are the simplest to do and every fighter in NeoDBZ knows how to fight this way; to varying degrees. Everyone knows how to throw a Punch or a Kick, but not everyone is particularly good at it. Basic Attacks are a list of moves everyone starts with, but more advanced Powers can be picked up. H2H Attacks use your DEX/5 Strike Mod and use STR/5 as your Damage Mod.</p> <p>Sword or Weapon Attacks are very similar to H2H Attacks, with their own complications. Anyone can pick up a toothpick – erm, Sword, and swing it. Everyone knows how to make a ‘Basic Sword Attack’. More advanced Sword techniques are bought from the Sword category. All Sword Attacks use your DEX/5 to strike and use the better of your STR/10 or SPD/5 for your Damage mod. Weapons will have base dice listed under their Equipment information.</p> <p>For Example: (2d10 + 1d10 per Level + STR/10 ) + Misc Mods + Bulk. 1 End.</p> <p>Ki Attacks can be more complex; some fighters never learn how to gather their energy to the degree to turn it into a blast of destructive energy. In order to perform Ki attacks; you must get the appropriate power from the Offensive Ki tree - there is no Ki Attack that everyone knows intuitively. Ki attacks use your MNT/5 as the modifier to Strike and to Damage. Ki Attack dice vary depending on how much Ki is spent on them, which scales with Level.</p> <p>For Example: (5d8 per Level + MNT/5 ) + Misc mods . Basic Discharge; 25 ki cost per Level.</p> <p>Finally, along the same vein as Ki Attacks are Telekinetic (TK) Attacks; which function similar to Ki Attacks, but they never benefit from Damage not specifically mentioning TK and Superspeeds cannot be used with or against them, with few exceptions.</p> <p>If your opponent Blocks; you can just roll 1d20 to check for a Critical without any bonuses, since it doesn’t matter.</p> <p>Addons have been mentioned before and it’s anything that might modify your Strike or Damage outside of what is the basic template. Such as Bulks, Superspeeds, using Uniques like PKU or Racial Features. Include Status Effects that may apply too; such as Stun, AP/SP/UP/US/etc. Auto-Criticals, for example are very important to mention.</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <ol> <li>Changing up Defense When you’re attacked, you almost always have the chance to defend yourself.</li> </ol> <p>Dodging: A Defense anyone can do; it costs nothing to do and is a simple attempt to get out of the way of an attack. You roll 1d20 + SPD/5 + Misc Dodge Modifiers in response to their Attack. If the result is the same or higher than theirs, you’ve successfully dodged! If your result is lower, they hit you with full force.</p> <p>Blocking is available once you obtain the ‘Block’ Power. When you block, you allow your opponent to hit you, but you take less than the full amount of Damage. In most cases, you divide the total Damage by 2.</p> <p>Parrying is another option you can do and like Blocking, requires you to have specific Powers to do so. To Parry with your bare hands, you must have the H2H Parry Power, while Parrying with a Weapon, requires the Parrying Strike Power. Parrying with your mind requires the Telekinetic Parry power.</p> <p>Advanced forms of Defenses often have costs associated with their Power and will state as such.</p> <ol> <li>Advanced Damage Reduction The order in which you reduce damage is always as follows:</li> </ol> <p>1) Auras / Shields Various Auras and Shields will become useable as you unlock these Powers. Auras function to reduce Damage, by paying Ki. Shields meanwhile are often a layer of conditional HP, some of which may recover during the fight.</p> <p>Auras and Shields cannot be stacked unless the Power specifically states otherwise. If Defending against a Combo Power (multiple, different attacks in the same APR), you can only use one Aura or Shield per Attack in the Combo; which may mean some Attacks simply cannot be reduced in this way.</p> <p>For example; If you got hit by a Combo involving Multi Punch and then Power Punch, you would not be able to use an Shield Percing Resistant shield on both attacks, but you could use Aura of Protection against the Multi Punch and Supreme Aura against the Power Punch.</p> <p>Auras can be scaled to your desired effect, up to its maximum. While Shields must be used to their maximum ability. While declaring Defenses, you do not need to specify which Auras or Shields you might use, only when Damage Reduction is resolved.</p> <p>Shields and Auras cannot be used while Unconcious, unless the Power specifically states otherwise. Finally, Auras and Shields always apply before Block or other forms of Reduction.</p> <p>Template: ( Damage - Shield or Aura )</p> <p>2) Blocking A power from the Defensive power tree, Blocking allows you to brace for impact of an Attack. You’re automatically hit, a Critical Hit d20 is rolled, but you’re able to reduce the Damage significantly by preparing for it. Blocking divides the damage in half or more.</p> <p>You must declare you are Blocking and with which specific Block Bower you’re using.</p> <p>Template: ( Damage Dealt /2 )</p> <p>3) Armor &amp; Natural Armor (Nat Armour) If you’re wearing Armor or perhaps grew it yourself as Natural Armor; both are functionally the same and mentioning the one is generally also talking about the other. Armor is an additional buffer for your Hitpoints, that is subtracted from the damage immediately after the Aura / Shielding process. Applied before blocking. Certain things can reduce the effectiveness of Armor or bypass it entirely, so be sure to read anything listed beside the Damage dealt.</p> <p>If you have a form of Natural Armor, you can not wear Armor on top of it (and no, you can’t wear multiple layers of wearable Armors either). If you gain Natural Armor while wearing Armor; your Armor is flexed or forced off of you without further damage.</p> <p>Armors are often bought or made and sometimes have additional effects. Most Worn Armors also have an associated XP Penalty if used in less serious fights. Wearing Armor can be an indicator of ‘meaning business’.</p> <p>Armors must be donned and declared in your first Initiative Pre-round in order to be used in combat and may not be added during an ongoing battle; though some effects may add Nat Armor. Nat Armor must always be applied, though doesn’t need Declaring.</p> <p>Template: (Damage Dealt - Aura - Armor)</p> <p>Blocking Template: (Damage Dealt - Aura - Armor) / 2</p> <p>4) Resistance Resistance is the last form of Damage Reduction. Resistance ensures that whatever force gets past your Auras, Blocking and Armor, it then doesn’t do you much damage. Hopefully. The most common form of Resistance is given to you by your Racial Resistance found in your Race’s information, but there are certain uniques and powers which grant some fighters additional Resistance as well.</p> <p>Resistance acts much like Armor, in that it reduces an attack’s damage before it’s dealt to your Hitpoints, except that it doesn’t diminish. Things which bypass or reduce any Armor you’re wearing also bypass Resistance, unless stated otherwise.</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Multiple sources of Resistance stack; so if you had Level x 4 Resistance from your Race and 5 x Level from a Power or Unique, you would have a total of Level x 9 Resistance.</p> <p>Unlike other forms of Damage Reduction; Resistance always applies even when unconcious.</p> <p>Template: (Damage Dealt - Resistance)</p> <p>Normally, all these steps are put together as a single Reduction calculation in combat, in which case it would look like this:</p> <p>(Damage Dealt - Shield or Aura - Armor ) /2 - Resistance</p> <ol> <li>Health and Energy Everyone has Hitpoints (HP), Lifepoints (LP), Ki and Endurance (END). The exception to this is Androids, which have no END as detailled in their racial information. While there is no direct penalty to losing Ki, HP or END; common sense would dictate that if you’re at half HP, then your character looks beaten up. Same with being at half END - you might be sweating or breathing heavily from fatigue. Ki is less noticeable in terms of how much you have, versus how much you’re missing; though it may be sensed in your Powerlevel lowering or a spiritual tiredness, in place of physical exertion.</li> </ol> <p>You do not Gain the benefits of Out of Combat Recovery, while there is an ongoing fight in your scene. Even if you’re not part of it.</p> <p>1) Hit Points (HP) These points represent how much damage you can take and should be considered superficial injuries such as bruises, minor cuts and other cool anime moments. None of it has a lasting impact on the body’s performance. When you are reduced to 0 HP, you are conscious, but defenseless. Damage beyond this, accident or otherwise, goes to your Life Points. You recover 5% of your Maximum HP every Neo hour (7 IRL minutes) Out of Combat. Losing HP also reduces your Powerlevel.</p> <p>2) Chi (Ki) These points represent your spiritual energy. How much you have and how well you can use it. You spend it to enhance the stength and speed of your Attacks, as well as to reduce the damage you take and more. You recover 5% of your Maximum Ki every Neo hour Out of Combat. Gaining or Losing KI; by way of Charging or Spending Ki, effects your Powerlevel.</p> <p>3) Lifepoints (LP) These points represent the natural resilience of your body to survive without any conscious aid from you in the face of actual, deeper tissue Damage. If you run out of Hitpoints, Damage then goes to your Lifepoints. Losing LP can be akin to internal bleeding, damaged organs or worse. If you lose all your LP, you are Dead. LP must be recovered to full, before you’re no longer Defenseless, but at least HP recovery occurs concurrently. LP recovers slowly at a rate of Level x 2 every Neo Hour.</p> <p>Healing Powers will specify if it applies to LP, HP or both. If you’re healed while in LP and the heal only applies to HP; you gain it as normal to HP.</p> <p>For example; if you were KO’d by an Attack that takes you into 100 LP’s (-100 HP) and you were Level 5, you would take 70 Real-Life minutes to no longer be Defenseless.</p> <p>4) Sub-Lifepoints (Sub-LP) These points are a rare form of additional Lifepoints that represent a characters ability to survive even beyond what most consider death. While in Sub-LP, you give off no power Level or pulse, as if you were dead. Your body might be completely destroyed, down to its cells and cannot be targetted for additional Damage or a killing move while in this state. Even if someone does try; simply pretend to take the Damage or state you’re Dead and remain at 1 Sub-LP. At least the first time they witness this Sub-LP without knowing better, anyway.</p> <p>Once you’re back to 1 LP, you once more have a pulse and Powerlevel. You must recover all Sub-LP before you can begin recovering LP. HP does not recover while in Sub-LP.</p> <p>If a person that has witnessed this state of death before from the same person, or is a member of the same Race with the same near-Death state, or has been told their state of near-Death exists (care not to metagame), then the Sub-LP fails to protect the user from being targeted further. Only one person present who knows this information, can target the remains with a Ki Attack and only once to try to kill the person with Sub-LP. This Coup De Grace can be interrupted using Initiative.</p> <p>If this Coup De Grace fails to deal enough damage to put you to 0 Sub-LP or below, then congratulations, you’re still alive. And you regain Sub-LP at double the rate you’d gain LP.</p> <p>If someone you killed came back to life; you’d be suspicious of their next “Death” too.</p> <p>5) Endurance (END) These points determine how physically ‘fit’ you are and just how long you can go on fighting. You pay 1 Endurance (minimum) for every Action you take, unless otherwise specified. Some Attacks might cost more and they will state as such in their descriptions. When you have 0 END, you have over-exerted yourself and you go Unconscious. If you were performing an Action or Defense that takes you into negative END; the action is aborted and fails (No-Defense, in the case of Defenses).</p> <p>You regain 25% of your Maximum END every Neo hour.</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>6) Regeneration (Regen) In combat, some individuals heal or recharge faster than others. It means you recover it’s value in HP, LP, Ki or End (or whatever it is that you Regen) at the start of your Actions in a Round, before starting the Action. This happens even on Actions you’re stunned or otherwise unable to act, unless the Power specifically states it prevents Regen.</p> <p>If you Regen at an accelerated rate during Combat, you also recover just as quickly Out of Combat. Add the amount you Regen per action without multiplying by Level, to the % you recover per Neo Hour, to find your new % value.</p> <p>For instance, if you Regen Level x 6 HP per Action and you’re Level 3 and per-Neo Hour you natively Recover 5%; you Recover at a rate of 11% per Neo Hour.</p> <p>If you recover LP faster than normal, then you add your per-Action LP Regen directly to how much LP or Sub-LP you Recover from every Neo Hour. + Level x 1 LP Regen causes you to Recover +Level x 1 LP every Neo Hour.</p> <p>Sources of Regen stack.</p> <p>7) Defenseless &amp; Unconcious (KO’d) So, your HP has hit 0 and you may or may not be in LP. You’re now in a ‘Defenseless’ state. This means you’re immediately removed from any Initiative and ignored in combat, to deal with more immediate threats if they’re present (even if you’re the sole target).</p> <p>While Defenseless; you cannot spend Ki, End, Block or Move. You can choose to be Concious in order to talk, but may not operate Communicators - maybe they’re just out of reach or your arm hurts too much to press the button, or other technology unless someone does it for you.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if your END gets to 0, you’re in the ‘Unconcious’ state and similarly vulnerable; but unable to talk, too. Running out of Ki as an Android is equivilant to running out of END.</p> <p>If you are KO’d in the middle of defending against an ‘Action string’ or Multi-Attack involving multiple Strike rolls, your opponent may cease or abort the Attack at any time after the final blow that renders you KO’d, still paying the Costs as normal. Combos can not be pulled in this way and full Damage must apply; Sword Combos that function as a MultiSlash can be pulled.</p> <p>Why can’t you target someone KO’d while being attacked? Fights are fluid and fast and if you’re busy looking at the wrong person even for a split-second, it won’t go well for you.</p> <p>Some Criticals or Powers might be capble of inflicting an Auto-KO, while some Criticals can inflict Death.</p> <p>8) Death (Dead) Once you’ve run out of LP, Sub-LP and tricks; unable to save yourself. You may declare Death or Dead. Yamcha’d. Ex-Parrot. Pushing up Daisies. Etc. Consider carefully before declaring Death, because a more experienced player may be able to point out a Damage Reduction, Power or correction that avoids being upset by your story ending by mere Accident or miscalculation.</p> <p>This is a PVP game; so it’s important to take time to cool off if the loss of a character is upsetting. It’s weird to say, but attachment is a real thing.</p> <p>In the event of Death; do not delete your sheet. In some circumstances, Death is not the end and jumping to conclusions as to what a GM has planned or if your character was beloved to be brought back, is another mistake in the heat of the moment.</p> <p>Passive shields, such as Solid Aura or forms of Resistance continue to function while Unconcious, which could save your life in the event of an accident. Invents that feign Death also exist, otherwise an opponent can tell you’re in positive LP by your Powerlevel.</p> <p>9) Feigning Death Unfortunately, pretending to be Dead can be metagamed against; so you must be weary about telling people In-Character about Techniques or Features you have, if you want to live a long and happy life. Invents like Taisha’s Charge can make you appear Dead and immune to further Damage, to anyone who doesn’t know it anyway.</p> <p>Since surpressing your Powerlevel can not go below 1; technically you can never ‘pretend’ to be Dead, if the person can sense you. And that might be a dick move to do to your friends. Sometimes it’s just safer to surrender a fight before it gets so far.</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Criticals and 20’s Rolls of 1’s in NeoDBZ are simply low rolls; unlike other games and do not automatically fail - though it’s certainly more likely you will fail, since you rolled the lowest result possible and your opponent might be more fortunate.</p> <p>Rolls of 20’s, however, tend to have some special effect tied with them depending upon what kind of roll you were making as detailled below.</p> <p>1) Strike Rolls When you roll a 20 on a Strike roll, it automatically hits unless the Defender rolls a 20 on their Dodge or Parry and the result of the Defense is a higher result than the Attack. The Attack automatically becomes Armor Piercing and Shield Piercing and if it deals Damage after Damage Reduction; you’ve Critically Damaged your opponent and roll a 1d100 to see what effects occur, outlined in the Critical Hits section. Multi-Attacks can never inflict a Critical Hit; but may still be AP/SP. Finally, Sword Criticals apply their 1d100 prior to damage and may often become AP/UP.</p> <p>2) Dodge Rolls When you roll a 20 on a Dodge roll; the Attack is automatically Dodged unless the Attacker rolled a Natural 20 for his Strike and his modifiers beat yours. If you’re not hit, you’re allowed an Immediate counterattack without using an Action. This can be any Basic Attack and costs END / Ki as required. Addons can be utilized by paying costs as normal. A Grab cannot be a counter.</p> <p>3) Parry Rolls When you roll a 20 on a Parry (be it TK, H2H or Sword), the Parry automatically succeeds unless your Opponent rolls a higher Strike on a 20. The END loss your Opponent suffers is doubled; TK Parries do nothing additional and do not gain this double effect.</p> <p>4) Parry Blast Rolls When you roll a 20 on a Parry Blast, you can choose to Immediately slap the blast back where it came from at no additional Ki cost and the Damage becomes AP/SP. If it’s a Ki Attack that cannot be returned, it’s simply Parried away instead. The Attacker becomes the Defender against your Parry Blast result as if it wasn’t an automatic hit. If Damage goes to HP; it is not a Critical Hit unless their attack had been a Nat 20 and you beat their Strike roll through modifiers.</p> <p>5) Auto-Critical Effects If an Attack is Auto-Critical (or higher, ala DAC) and a 20 is rolled; the Critical effect escalates to the next level (AC becomes a Double Critical, DAC becomes a Triple critical). Triple criticals can not be escalated further and 20’ing on them only auto-hits - unless your opponent rolls a Nat 20 and beats your final result. Auto-Critical effects are not AP/SP like a Nat 20, but become so if a Nat 20 is rolled.</p> <p>If someone Advanced Blocks or otherwise reduces an AC effect, a d20 is still rolled. If a Nat 20 is rolled; the Critical upgrades and then is reduced by the Block back down. It still has a risk of escalating further if the 1d100 is rolled high enough to do so.</p> <p>Natural 20’s only inflict a Critical Effect upon the victim if they take Damage after Reductions! If the defender can reduce the damage to 0; then they do not suffer a Critical Effect</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Damage Types There are several different types of Damage. While damage is dealt almost exclusively to an opponent’s HP, some types of damage is significantly harder to stop than others.</p> <p>Armor Piercing (AP) Attacks with this effect go through Armor and Resistance more effectively, splitting half of the Damage stopped by Armor, to HP. Addiitonally, it halves Resistance.</p> <p>Example: (Damage) to Armor and +(Damage Stopped)/2 to HP before Damage Reduction.</p> <p>Ignore Armor (IA) This type of effect acts as though you weren’t wearing nothin’ at all! (even Nat Armor) and goes right through Armor. Resistance is also ignored. If an attack is IA; it doesn’t need mention it’s AP.</p> <p>Armor Shattering (AS) This type of effect blasts Armor to destruction; dealing its full Damage to Armor and HP (as if it ignored it). Resistance is also ignored. If an Attack is AS; it doesn’t need mentioning if it’s AP or IA.</p> <p>Shield Piercing (SP) This type of effect is harder to stop with Ki and tends to find gaps to plow through. Some Shields and Auras will state they are able to work against SP Attacks.</p> <p>Unpreventable (UP) This type of effect is nearly impossible to stop with your Ki. UP damage needs a special Shield or Aura that can block UP, because Armors also do not work to stop it! UP Attacks cannot be countered with Discharges.</p> <p>Unshieldable (US) The hardest-hitting and rarest type of Damage there is, it can not be prevented by any kind of Shield or Aura.</p> <p>Attack Addons These modify an Attack to do something special; be it being able to redirect the attack, cause someone to continually take HP / End Damage, or by stunning them.</p> <p>Superspeeds, PKU, Bulks, Features and other Powers can also be considered Addons.</p> <p>Remote Attacks Ki Attacks sometimes have the property of being Remote; which means they can be redirected after being fired to try and hit someone who Dodged the attack initially. This requires a second Ki Strike roll, which can’t benefit from any form of Superspeed or Teleportation.</p> <p>Remote can’t be used after a Freeze. It can also be used to redirect your own attack away from yourself (or others) after a Parry, Misdirect or other effect, so long as it’s before Damage is rolled (including following a failed Defense).</p> <p>To utilize this addon; you repay the original cost of the Attack without Superspeeds.</p> <p>Double Remote The same vein as Remote; but allowing two redirects. By spending both redirects; a KI Attack can be Remoted against the power Freeze or back at someone who Parried Blast back at the user. To utilize this Addon; you repay the original cost of the Attack without Superspeeds for each time it’s redirected.</p> <p>Stun Attacks This Addon causes the target to lose one or more of their next available Action(s) if they take Damage from the Attack; the Attack will state how long a target is Stunned for. Advanced Blocking a Stun attack normally prevents the Stun effect. While Stunned, a person is unable to use their Actions, unless a Feature or Power states otherwise (such as Regen).</p> <p>Stun doesn’t stack; a person Stunned can’t be Stunned again until they’ve had an Action where they could perform an Attack, Charge or Rest between Stuns.</p> <p>In the case of the Critical Effects ‘Disoriented’, ‘Phased’, or ‘Stunned’, the regular automatic one-Action Stun from the pain of a Critical Hit is replaced by the named effects.</p> <p>Flaming or Bleeding Attacks These Addons cause a target to lose 2% of their max HP and END (rounded down) at the start of their Actions (even stunned ones) similar to Regen, but before Regen. This loss has a minimum of 1 point and cannot be reduced in any way. This effect persists for the Attacker’s Level in APR or until Combat ends (and the character presumably treats themselves). Flaming / Bleeding Attacks must deal Damage to apply its effect (or in the case of Sword Multi’s; the final Attack must do the damage). This effect does not stack, but it does reset the timer.</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Auto Critical Attacks These kinds of attacks are especially deadly and automatically inflict a critical hit upon the opponent if they hit and deal damage. If a 20 is rolled for an AC attack, it automatically escalates to a double critical. These attacks are not naturally AP/SP like an attack which has a 20 rolled for its strike, but often are some type of special damage type.</p> <p>(AC) Auto Critical These kinds of attacks inflict a level one critical if they deal damage.</p> <p>(DAC) Double Auto Critical These kinds of attacks inflict a level two critical if they deal damage.</p> <p>(TAC) Triple Auto Critical These kinds of attacks inflict a level three critical if they deal damage. If a natural 20 is rolled with a TAC attack, no additional escalation is possible. A natural 20 still makes it auto-hit and AP/SP.</p> <p>Invents Inventions or simply Invents, are special techniques that are your own creation or refer to School Invents. Every character has one invent at creation and gains another invent every fourth level (4, 8, 12, etc). They’re usable once every two rounds, unless otherwise stated. For obvious reasons - invents that deal lasting damage such as Autocrit or Double autocrit should be reserved for Deathmatches or trying to actually kill your opponent, since they might take offense to it being used in a normal fight.</p> <p>Declaring your Invent in combat: If you use a school invent you have to state the school or the invent name, as you would declaring any other power. If you use a personal Invent, you have to make clear what kind of Invent it is: Ki, Sword or H2H, what level invent it is and whether it is a Single Attack or a Multi Attack, through stating it OOC as if it’s an addon. Unlike previous restarts - personal addons do not need to be declared if they have auto crit/double auto crit.</p> <p>If you use a personal Shield Invent and have more than one personal Shield Invent, you have to state OOC what level you gained the invention at similarly to the above.</p> <p>Remember, you can’t improve School Invents except by levelling up; their scaling improvement will be explained in the School Invent information.</p> <p>Ki invents have a number of special rules, listed below.</p> <p>Countering This Ki attack add-on allows you to use your Ki invent against an incoming Ki attack invent. Multi Attack Ki invents can’t be countered or used to counter. Instead of dodging, parrying, or blocking, you state as your defense that you’re using your level x Ki attack invent to Counter. You both roll the damages of your Ki attacks and subtract the lower result from the higher one. The result is the amount of damage that goes to the one with the weaker blast.</p> <p>The one who receives the damage can’t dodge, block or parry the incoming damage, but he can use any reflexive shield or aura to reduce the damage. If the attack that was overcome was generated by two or more people using a Ki Attack Invent with the Combo add-on, all of them receive the full remaining damage.</p> <p>This option may only be selected if you have purchased the Ki Attack Invention addon “Counter”; which also allows you to add further damage into the attack to overwhelm them.</p> <p>Charging Ki Invents These invents can be extremely powerful, but require time in order to be used to their maximum potential. Trying to gain the energy to fire these kinds of invents without taking time to do so is risky and inefficient, though it is possible. The biggest risk comes from the fact that if there is an action in which you cannot charge (such as being stunned or trapped in a capture ball) you lose all of your charges, the energy dissipating harmlessly into the environment.</p> <p>The way you pay the ki cost of a charging invent is different from the usual up-front powers that use ki. Insted of paying the cost of the attack and simply charging damage, you charge the invent to pay for the cost of the attack before you can charge damage. You can choose to fire the attack on the same action that you finish paying for the base cost of the attack, though the minimum amount of actions you can charge is two. If you gathered enough with a single charge, it means you must wait for your second action to fire it. You can not charge Ki for damage and fire the Ki attack on the same action. However, if you charge to pay for the Ki cost of the invent and have charged ki leftover, you can add the remainder to the damage for free and still fire it on that same action as if it was spill over.</p> <p>Instead, you can choose to pay an additional 50% of the ki invent attack’s base Ki Cost and not spend any time charging. This means you don’t need to spend any previous actions charging when using a counter ki invent as mentioned above, but this additional cost still applies.</p> <p>While powering up a blast, you can’t parry or dodge or use the Telekinetic power Freeze. You can still block and use auras and shields however. If you’re damaged while you’re charging up, you do not run the risk of losing your blast.</p> <p>If someone tries to grab you while you’re charging, you may fire your invent immediately at them but may not be used with the Counter Addon. They can’t dodge, block or parry, but can use any reflexive shield or aura. The attacker loses his action and does not complete his grab, if he takes damage. If you have not paid the base Ki cost for the invent, you must pay the +50% ki cost as mentioned earlier if you were unable to pay for the base cost in your charged actions. This is the only way you may fire an invent before the normal 2 charge minimum.</p> <p>Damage multipliers never affect the additional charged damage of a Ki attack, though they do multiply the rest of the ki attack as they normally would, like a bulk. Any Ki attack which is charged up can’t be fired with a Superspeed, however actual teleportation powers (Kai Kai and IT) can be used with them.</p> <p>Example: Gohan wants to power up his invent; Masenko, which costs him 225 Ki. The best charging power he has is Enhanced Charge, which only gives him 50 Ki per acion. He’d have to spend at least 5 actions charging Ki before he could fire off the invent or else he would have to pay for an additional 50% cost. The extra 25 Ki he charges in the fifth action would add the leftover 25 Ki to damage. He could even choose to charge for more damage, but if he chooses to do so; he can’t charge damage on the same action in which he fires his attack.</p> <p>Notes:</p> <p>If you’re blinded by the power Taiyoken and someone attempts to grab you while you’re charging, you can still fire your blast at them. Taiyoken is not considered a true stun and does not prevent charging; only firing the attack. The Ligon power “Time Freeze” can be used during Charging a Ki attack. Multi Attacks These are attacks which forego finesse for raw, overwhelming force or as many blasts as can be thrown out in a short period of time. Despite it’s name, you only roll a single strike roll for a Multi Attack with the exception of Sword Multi’s detailed later. For Hand to Hand and Ki, these attacks are represented by the formula they use under the listed powers. For example:</p> <p>(# of attacks)x(base damage+STR/MNT mod) + misc bonuses</p> <p>With this kind of damage, you only add your miscellaneous bonuses once, even though you’re making multiple attacks. Sword multi’s work differently by rolling its strike and damage once for each hit in the multi, unless otherwise stated by the power in use.</p> <p>For example: A level 11 Multi Slash is 6 seperate rolls and basic damages.</p> <p>Superspeeds These powers enhance your speed for the entire action (an entire attack, or an entire defense) and thus don’t need to be paid for with each attack you make in a single action. If you’re using a combo or anything that requires multiple rolls in one action, the Attacker and Defender get their chosen Superspeed bonus applied to all their rolls for that action.</p> <p>Bulk Unlike Superspeed, Bulk is a burst of strength and can only apply to a single attack if you make multiple attacks in one action. Bulk is added to the first strike of a Multislash, the last hit of a Twice and the last hit of any Combos (this rule includes H2H and Ki, PKU and Bulk work the same way, applying only to the last hit in a combo).</p> <p>Critical Hits Multi’s cannot score a critical hit, but may be AP/SP on a natural roll of 20.</p> <p>Combos Despite it’s name; a Combo is considered a flurry of blows not unlike a Multi Attack, however it’s a series of follow-up attacks leading to a final blow. Combo’s only use a single strike roll for all the attacks involved in the combo - the exception to this is Sword Combo’s, which follow the same rules as Sword Multi Attacks and roll their seperate strikes.</p> <p>Bulk Bulk or effects like bulk (such as Bulking Aura), are only applied to the final strike in a combo and only ever applies once. This includes PKU, because it functions like a Bulk.</p> <p>Superspeeds Superspeeds function largely the same as a Multi Attack, meaning all strikes involved in a combo uses the same Superspeed.</p> <p>Critical Hits Combos cannot score a critical hit, but may be AP/SP on a natural roll of 20.</p> <p>Damage Multipliers Damage multipliers can be anything from the benefits of a unique, to the damage multiplier of an Uppercut, to the Sword power Thrust. These are anything that improves the damage by a percentage (+50%, +10%, +100%, etc). Or reduces the damage by a percentage (-50%, -10%, etc).</p> <p>When the damage of an attack is multiplied, the base damage dice of the attack and the Stat mod relevant to the attack are the only parts of the damage that get multiplied unless otherwise stated. Any other damage you gain to the attack (namely, your miscellaneous bonuses) does not get multiplied by the percentage.</p> <p>Multi Attacks (including Combos in this definition) can gain the benefit of having their damage multiplied as well, but the effect is reduced because of the amount of attacks you’re making at once, unless otherwise stated. They receive half the normal damage bonus as other attacks. So if you had +10% to all H2H damage (from say, Damaging Aura) and you make a Multi Punch attack, you would gain +5%, instead of the usual +10%.</p> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 You R.
