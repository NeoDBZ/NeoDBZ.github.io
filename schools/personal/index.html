<p>First you must have a Race or other effect that grants you a personal School. Usually, this means being a Martial Artist, Kaio, or Restricted. Often you can teach one or more people your special school, using the rules in the appropriate race nodes. Once you have permission to create a Personal School, you may do so by following these three easy steps:</p> <p>Determine Bonus Powers Select two Powers, not counting Fighting Style exclusive powers. You learn both of those powers, ignoring normal prerequisits. Whenever anyone else learns your school, they may select and learn one of those powers.</p> <p>Determine Stats You have 42 points to split among stats, with no more than 12 in any one category. Anyone -else- who learns your school gains only half of these stats, rounded up.</p> <p>Create School Invent When creating this school, you create a Personal Hand-to-Hand, Sword, Ki or Statbooster invent. This begins with 30 base points, and advances like a level 1 Invent, regardless of what level you learn the school. In addition to the normal options, your Personal School Invent gains a special “Invent Unique” appropriate for its category.</p> <p>Map the Unique out to level 10. After that, people are free to choose how to advance the Personal School unique as students invent new ways to use old tricks.</p> <p>SPECIAL If you learn a personal school with a Statbooster, you may “retrain” a statbooster you already know, changing it to something else. You may not retrain statboosters granted by your race.</p> <p>Invent Uniques:</p> <p>Hand to Hand:</p> <p>1) Smoldering Ashes Your attack lights the target aflame with your passion. On hit, the target takes 10% of the attack’s pre-reduced damage on each of their turns for the attacker’s level in actions. This added damage has any add-ons the original attack did (such as AP, SP, AC, et cetera). This damage may not be dodged or blocked, but barriers and other forms of defenses work normally.</p> <p>2) Martial Flow When performing any applicable combo, your invent can be used in place of any Hand-to-Hand attack that would normally be used there (ignoring any normal restrictions such as, for example, a move needing to be “any Hand to Hand attack that isn’t an invent”). For example, using an H2H combo you could perform a Multi-Punch followed by this invent.</p> <p>3) Phantom Strike Your attack defies normal means of perception. Maybe you punch the air and your opponent gets hit, maybe you turn out the lights–something like that. The end result is, it can’t be parried for one reason or another. As a bonus, this ignores all temporary penalties to strike (such as from critical effects or a Yarkon’s Piece of Home).</p> <p>4) Bloody Knuckles Your attack can draw upon your own life energy to fuel it. When you declare this attack, you may sacrifice any % of your current HP. If you do, add +1 to the attack’s strike per 20% of your maximum HP sacrificed, and make the attack deal +1% damage for each 1% of your current HP sacrificed. If the loss of this HP would put you at 0 HP or below, you may still complete the attack, but immediately fall unconscious at the end of the attack. You may not sacrifice more than 100% of your current HP to this attack.</p> <p>Weapon:</p> <p>1) Rend the Spirit Your blade cuts not just flesh, but the very life force of anyone it strikes, while performing this technique. The victim loses Ki equal to the amount of damage they take, along with (total damage taken)/100 Endurance. Due to the spiritual nature of the, brute force is less useful than usual; you may not use any Ki Body Enhancement Powers other than Bulking Aura on this invent.</p> <p>2) Dancing Blade If your attack misses, you may release your sword, at which point it will continue pursuing the intended on its own (via some sort of mystical spiritual whatever). In game terms, the weapon makes another strike roll for the invent at the start of each of your actions, for (level)/2 actions or until it hits, at the original target. You may not use your sword while it is occupied this way, though may spend an action to retrieve it. After it hits or the timer expires, it returns to you automatically (at the start of your next action). If the opponent uses freeze, then no more strike rolls are made. The sword does not benefit from any super speeds you used or critical effects you’re suffering from, but otherwise uses the same strike bonuses you had at the time this attack was launched. If used with a sword multi-attack, the ‘Dancing’ feature only applies to the invent’s final strike.</p> <p>3) Flash of Steel You may use your invent as a pre-round action, a maximum of once per battle. This benefits from any other pre-round effects you have active (and your opponent, similarly, receives any such appropriate benefits), and does not take up one of your actions in the round. Any uses-per-round or per-battle used count towards the round that is beginning.</p> <p>4) Bloodthirsty Steel You recover HP and Ki equal to 50% of the damage dealt.</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Offensive Ki:</p> <p>1) Spiritual Singularity When charging into your invent, you automatically charge twice per action (for twice as much damage added to it, and 2 uses towards your maximum number of charges per battle). However, devoting every ounce of ki you can into an attack comes with a downside: you may not spend any ki while charging this invent.</p> <p>2) Wellspring of Aura When you begin charging your invent, you acquire a special, SP-resistant barrier that has HP equal to 20% of your maximum Ki. It even absorbs US and UP damage, though they deal double damage to the barrier. Each action you spend charging your attack adds the amount of ki charged (but not bonus damage from Increased Charging, or ‘extra’ charges from sources like Golden Charge) to the barrier’s health. While it remains, you may not be grappled and are immune to the Capture Ball power. When the barrier’s HP is depleted, you can no longer charge your attack, and must fire it on your next action.</p> <p>3) Relentless Pursuit If your attack misses, you may ‘remote’ it (as per the normal rules for that add-on) on later actions. This may be done a maximum of once per action, for any number of consecutive actions, until: the attack hits, you run out of ki, or you take any other action on your turns.</p> <p>4) Natural Attunement Your invent costs no Ki to perform. It benefits from Superior Enlarged Ki Blast based on its ‘normal’ cost, but you do not actually pay any Ki or Endurance to fire it (or, if you have the appropriate add-on, Remote or Double Remote it). Additionally, this ease of use allows you to put more focus into refining the technique itself, increasing its base Invent Points by 5.</p> <p>Stat Booster:</p> <p>1) Awakening Your invent can be activated both swiftly and efficiently, making up for what it lacks in raw power with ease of use. It can be activated as a pre-round effect, at any point in the round without having to spend an action, and even in response to an attack (alongside another defense, like dodging or using a shield). Additionally, it has no Endurance cost (the XP penalty, however, remains).</p> <p>2) Vitality Surge Your stat booster can also raise the user’s HP or Ki multipliers. It costs 10 Invent points for +1 to either mod, 20 for the next +1, 30 for the next, and so on (for a total of, in that case, 10+20+30 = 60 Invent Points for +3 to your HP or Ki multiplier; +1 to both, on the other hand, would cost only 10+10 = 20 Invent Points). Each multiplier point purchased this way adds 4 Endurance to your invent’s cost. You may only purchase a total of +(level)/3 points to your multipliers, either split up or all on the same one.</p> <p>3) Overdrive Your invent’s base points per level are lowered by 10. However, the user also deals +(level)x2% damage with all attacks (including TK and grapple attacks!) while it’s active. This stacks additively with other percent-based increases (such as Berserker or Damaging Aura), and is halved for multis like normal.</p> <p>4) Second Wind When your stat booster is activated, the user regains 20% of their maximum HP, Ki, and End (though the stat booster’s cost must still be paid), plus another 5% for every full round the battle has already gone for (i.e. 25% in round 2, 30% in round 3), to a maximum of 40% (if used in round 5 or later).</p> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2025 You R.
