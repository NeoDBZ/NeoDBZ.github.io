Buy a school for 10 Reputation Points. This takes 4 Neo weeks (4 real life days) to learn. Acquire it through a Unique. Rules pertaining to Schools:</p> <p>All School Invents can only be used 1/2 Rounds unless stated otherwise. If you gain a power from a school and you already know it, you can learn a power from the same tree, but must follow the standard power rules. If you already have all the powers from that tree, you instead gain nothing. School invents like Kamehameha do not need to be charged up before being fired, and cost nothing extra for not charging them up. School invents can not be improved with personal invent points. Bear School Powers</p> <p>Block Multi Punch Bulk Up Sense Ki Mega Bulk Up Invent Name: Kurokumaken Type: School Cost: 4 End UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This an advanced form of bearhug which makes full use of the user’s physical power to crush their opponent with their strength. This attack requires you to be in control of a grapple to use and it’s considered a H2H invent. This attack requires no strike roll (since you’re in a grapple) and deals (3d8+STR) damage in addition to all normal bonuses to H2H damage, excluding Damaging Aura. This attack can not be bulked, but the damage is Unpreventable.</p> <p>Template: {((3d8+STR+Str mod) + Misc mods)} UP</p> <p>Notes:</p> <p>If this is used in Oozaru or Golden Oozaru forms, your base Strength score is used; not your enhanced Strength score. Statistic Bonuses +3 Mnt, +6 Str, +4 Dex, +6 Stm and +4 Spd</p> <p>Cloud School Powers</p> <p>Basic Flight Combat Teleport Aura of Protection Sense Ki Rest Invent Name: Meditation Type: School UPR: 1/Battle Description: By concentrating and channeling Ki into their body, fighters with this power can recover from the exhaustion of fighting. You recover 15% of your Maximum Endurance; which can’t put you above your maximum.</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +5 Int +3 Mnt, +3 Str, +3 Dex, +3 Stm and +3 Spd, +3 points to distribute</p> <p>Crane School Powers</p> <p>Discharge Taiyoken Basic Flight Multi Fireball Ki Combo Invent Name: Dodonpa Type: School Cost: 1 End + (10 Ki per 1d8x10 ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This is a thin, but highly concentrated beam of Ki which is fired at high speeds to pierce your opponent. This attack deals 3d8x10 damage, +1d8x10 per level after one. The damage is always Armor Piercing and becomes Shield Piercing at level 3. This attack gains the ‘Counter’ add-on at level 6 and every level after that (7, 8, 9, etc) it gains a +1 strike bonus. Template: {(3d8x10 + 1d8xx10 per levelup + Ki mod) + Misc mods} AP</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +4 Mnt, +5 Str, +5 Dex, +5 Stm and +4 Spd</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Demon School Powers</p> <p>Multi Punch Slicing Attack Bulk Up Sense Ki Mega Bulk Up Invent Name: Demon Punch Type: School Cost: 4 End, + ( 10 Ki per 1d8x10 ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This is a quick, powerful jab that catches your opponent off-guard when they move to attack you; enhancing your body with the speed of a demon to strike them first. This power has a +5 to Strike and does 2d8x10 damage, +1d8x10 damage per level after one. At second level it becomes Armor Piercing, At level 6 it becomes Armor Shattering and at level 8 it becomes Flaming.</p> <p>This invent is unique and is used as a Defensive action. When your opponent declares an attack on you, you declare you’re using Demon Punch as your reaction. This causes you to strike at your opponent before their attack goes off, forcing them to defend against your attack first. They can take any defensive action against Demon Punch, but after it’s resolved, you can only block their attack - having thrown yourself off balance too much to try and dodge or parry. Perfect Block can not be used after Demon Punch.</p> <p>Demon Punch can only be used against powers that require a strike roll (ie, you cannot Demon Punch the powers Psionic Surge or Taiyoken, or anything similar) This power may not be used against itself. Template: {(2d8x10 + 1d8x10 per levelup + Str mod) + Misc mods + Bulk} Statistic Bonuses +3 Mnt, +6 Str, +6 Dex, +5 Stm and +4 Spd Dove School Powers</p> <p>Discharge Flight Aura of Protection Sense Ki Ki shield Invent Name: Heaven’s Sent Type: School Cost: 1 End + ( 150 ki per 1d3+1 ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This is a Ki attack which allows you to channel power from Heaven itself, sending a torrent of holy energy down upon your enemy. While gathering the energy for this attack, you’re surrounded by a white, peaceful glow which intensifies as the sky grows brighter. Many people say that this school is the polar opposite of the Demon school.</p> <p>You do 1d3+1 attacks every three levels (1, 3, 6, etc) and each attack does 2d6x10 damage. The damage becomes Armor Piercing at level 6 and Stuns your opponent for one action at level 12 if they take damage.</p> <p>Template: {(1d3+1, +1d3+1 per 3 levels)x(2d6x10+ Ki mod) + Misc mods}</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +6 Mnt, +3 Str, +4 Dex, +5 Stm and +6 Spd</p> <p>Dragon School Powers</p> <p>Block Power Block Aura of Protection Sense Ki Ki shield Invent Name: Muteki Shield Type: School Cost: 25 Ki per level UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This is a shield invent which surrounds the user with a dragon made out of their ki, which coils around them to protect them and lashes out right after the attacker strikes. This shield blocks out 4 point of damage per Ki spent, with a maximum of 25 Ki per level. It can be used reflexively and can stop SP damage. This shield flares back 10% of the damage it absorbed to the attacker, as UP/AS damage and unlike other types of flaring, this works against any form of attack that deals damage.</p> <p>Template: [25x4xlevel] Damage preventable, [(Damage reduced)/10] Flaring</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +5 Mnt, +5 Str, +4 Dex, +5 Stm and +4 Spd</p> <p>Hawk School Powers</p> <p>Flight Advanced Flight Multi Kick Damaging Aura Combat Teleport Invent Name: Hawk’s Dive Type: School Cost: 5 End, + ( 50 Ki per action ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This invent requires you to already be using some sort of flight. It gives you better control of your maneuverability while in the air and lets you perform which bursts which use your momentum to inflict more damage. Using this invent gives +5 to all Strikes and +Spd/4 to all Hand to Hand damages while it’s active. It lasts for a maximum of (level/2) actions, costing 50 ki per action it lasts and takes an action to activate. In splitform, this bonus only applies to the body using it.</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +4 Mnt, +5 Str, +5 Dex, +4 Stm and +6 Spd</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Mantis School Powers</p> <p>Thrust Slice Combat Teleport Sense Ki Sense Path Invent Name: Mantis Perfect Strike Type: School Cost: 5 End UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This power teaches patience and timing. It forces you to ignore everything going on in a battle in favor of finding that one, perfect moment to strike. It takes an action of preparation to use this ability, which gives a bonus of Dex/4 to a Sword strike on your next action and stacks with Superspeeds. This can not be used with a parry or for the Brutal Fighting Style’s special attack. If you don’t make a sword attack on the first action you have after using this, the bonus is simply lost. In splitform, this bonus only applies to the body using it.</p> <p>Template: {1d20+(Dex/5 + Dex/4 + Misc mods)}</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +4 Mnt, +5 Str, +5 Dex, +4 Stm and +5 Spd</p> <p>Mountain School Powers</p> <p>Sense Ki Rest Block Advanced Block Aura of Protection Invent Name: Perfect Block Type: School Cost: 8 End UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This power teaches you how to protect your body against massive amounts of damage. It teaches the proper stance for proper impact distribution, allowing you to remain standing after even the most deadly attacks. The concentration required for the technique means you can’t use any shields or auras to help reduce the damage, but armor and resistance function normally. You divide the total damage you receive by four. The Armor Piercing effect of an attack is negated when using this power, but Armor Shattering and Ignore Armor function normally.</p> <p>Template: [(Damage Taken - Armor)/4 - Resistance]</p> <p>Notes:</p> <p>This is not compatible with the defensive version of a Recoomian’s Adrenaline Boost, and it temporarily overrides the use of that power. Statistic Bonuses +4 Mnt, +4 Str, +4 Dex, +6 Stm and +5 Spd</p> <p>Owl School Powers</p> <p>Sense Ki Minor ESP Telekinesis Psionic Aura Invent Name: Pyrokinesis Type: School Cost: 1 End + ( 25 Ki per 1d8x10 damage, max 75 Ki +25 Ki per level) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: You have developed a unique form of telekinesis that involves fire and lots of it. With this power you are able to set things alight using nothing but your mind. This attack deals 3d8x10 AP Damage, +1d8x10 damage. At level 3 it becomes IA and at level 5 it becomes Flaming.</p> <p>Invent Name: Psionic Overflow Type: School Cost: Lose your last action of the round UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: You’ve learned how to focus your mind and restore your mental defenses. With this power, you can fully replenish your Psionic or Solid Aura immediately. Using this power takes an action to perform and also costs the user their last action in the round. This can be used on their last action in a round, with no extra loss of actions.</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +6 Mnt, +3 Str, +5 Dex, +4 Stm and +5 Spd</p> <p>Quicksilver School Powers</p> <p>Thrust Slice Aura of Protection Bulk-Up Sense Ki Invent Name: Silver Rage Type: School Cost: 1 End + ( 25 Ki per 1d8x10 ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: You charge your opponent with your blade held readied, but don’t actually strike them until the very last moment - waiting until they consider it a feint before you strike them in suprise. This attack deals normal sword damage, +1d8x10, with an additional 1d8x10 every even level (2, 4, 6, etc). This attack is Armor Piercing and becomes Unpreventable at level 8.</p> <p>Template: {((Sword damage + 1d8x10, +1d8x10 every even level + Str mod) + Misc mods + Bulk} AP</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +6 Mnt, +4 Str, +6 Dex, +4 Stm and +4 Spd</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Shadow School Powers</p> <p>Combat Teleport Advanced Combat Teleport Basic Flight Sense Ki Sense Path Invent Name: Shadowform Type: School Cost: 10 End UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: Using this power, you can temporarily transform into a shadow-like being, which allows you to move exceptionally fast, if only for a short period of time. You can add your (Spd/8) to a Strike or Dodge roll. This power can not be used with other forms of Superspeed and costs 10 Endurance.</p> <p>Template: [Spd/8] to a Strike or Dodge roll</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +5 Mnt, +4 Str, +5 Dex, +4 Stm and +6 Spd</p> <p>Tiger School Powers</p> <p>Multi-Punch Combat Teleport Advanced Combat Teleport Bulk Up Sense Ki Invent Name: Tiger Strike Type: School Cost: 10 End UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This power teaches its users to concentrate on all their senses; not just sight and enables the user to temporarily heighten them in order to track every moment their opponent makes. With this power, you can make a Hand to Hand strike be a fixed 20 (plus normal Bonuses) instead of rolling the 1d20. This grants none of the normal bonuses for rolling a 20 and doesn’t allow for a critical check, it just alters the d20 to a set number for maximium strike ability. If your strike roll has any other dice roll in it; such as from MCT or MACT, they are automatically maximized as well (4 on the MCT’s 1d4, 6 on the MACT’s 1d6, etc). This power can’t be used on a parry. In splitform, this bonus only applies to the body using it.</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +4 Mnt, +5 Str, +5 Dex, +5 Stm and +4 Spd</p> <p>Turtle School Powers</p> <p>Discharge Charge Combat Teleport Sense Ki Advanced Discharge Invent Name: Kamehameha Type: School Cost: 1 End + ( 10 Ki per 1d8x10 ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: One of the most widely-known schools; this is a a ki attack which focuses your energy into a beam of ki. Its true power comes from being charged up for some time before being fired. This attack inflicts 3d8x10 damage, +1d8x10 damage per level up and begins with the Charging Ki Invent addition. Every second level, it gains an Increased Charging addition. Template: {(3d8x10 + 1d8x10 per level up + Mnt Mod) + Misc mods}</p> <p>Statistic Bonuses +5 Mnt, +5 Str, +4 Dex, +4 Stm and +5 Spd</p> <p>Vanguard School Powers</p> <p>Sense Ki Sense Path Rest Charge Enhanced Charge Invent Name: Taisha Charge Type: School UPR: 1/Battle Description: This power is a last-ditch defensive technique learned by a warrior to protect themselves after they fall in battle and continues to do so while unconcious. This power automatically activates whenever you receive enough damage to kill you. To your opponent; it has killed you. In reality, the technique is a shield that projects a false image and shrouds the user from detection, creating a ‘false body’ nearby that otherwise appears to be the real thing. This allows a malicious person all the freedom of mutiliating the corpse without it effecting the real body.</p> <p>Insted of dying, you are left with 1 LP and give off no power level. You recover once you have 1 HP and the image disappears.</p> <p>Only people with this invent are capable of spotting the real body; even pointing it out seems to leave others confounded. A subtle crimson aura surrounds a victim using this technique. But it doesn’t work more than once, really. Once a person has ‘killed’ you, they won’t make the same mistake twice and by that time they tend to include the immediate area in final attacks.</p> <p>Notes:</p> <p>If a race has Sub-LP, then this power activates when they run out of normal LP - effectively saving their Sub-LP from damage. Being told a person has this technique does not allow you to reconize it or go around it; you either have to have witnessed the person using it or have the technique itself. Statistic Bonuses +6 MNT, +3 STR, +3 DEX, +6 STM and +5 SPD</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Viper School Powers</p> <p>Discharge Combat Teleport Multi punch Sense Ki Charge Invent Name: Dokuken Type: School Cost: 1 End + ( 5 Ki per level ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This attack weakens an opponent by infusing them with corrupted Ki, weakening their spirit and diffusing their own energy. This is a Hand to Hand attack which has a +5 to strike and deals no damage - it instead causes a flat loss of 50 Ki per level of the attacker, which bypasses all forms of defenses to achieve. This infection persists for only a short while, preventing the victim from using any Powering Up powers or regenerating any Ki for (level/2) actions based on the attacker’s level. Round up for this.</p> <p>Template: [(levelx50)] Ki Lost, can’t Charge or Regenerate Ki for (level/2) actions</p> <p>Notes:</p> <p>If this is used on someone who’s charging a ki blst, it does not cause them to lose their attack. They can still fire it on their next action, but if they don’t it will dissipate harmlessly. Statistic Bonuses +5 Mnt, +4 Str, +5 Dex, +4 Stm and +5 Spd</p> <p>Volcano School Powers</p> <p>Thrust Slice Charge Combat Teleport Enhanced Charge Invent Name: Eruption Blade Type: School Cost: 2 End + ( 2 Endurance per strike after the first. Every extra hit consumes one of your Charges per battle after the first. ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: You charge a massive amount of energy into your weapon, before unleashing a series of swings that gradually lead into a final, powerful and explosive attack and strike your opponent with it. Upon the final collision, the excessive energy is released as a violent fiery explosion against your target.</p> <p>You gain 1+level/2.5 (round down) in strikes when using this power, each strike is its own seperate roll. The final attack must hit to gain the true benefit of this manuver. You can only add bulk to the first strike and the first strike may only crit. Crits on other rolls simply autohit and add SP/AP if the sword doesn’t already have it.</p> <p>For every strike before the last (level/2.5) that hits your target, you consume one use of Charge/Echarge/Hicharge (Limited by the powers you know, Megacharge may not be used). This cumulative damage is added to the end of your final attack like bulk. All of your attacks deal normal sword damage. The charges used counts against your per-battle maximum. This attack gains Flaming at level 8 on the final attack.</p> <p>Template First Strike: {((Sword damage + Str mod) + Misc mods + Bulk} Template Additional Strikes: {((Sword damage + Str mod) + Misc mods} Template Final Strike: {((Sword damage + Str mod) + Misc mods+ Charge}</p> <p>Notes:</p> <p>Supreme Aura and Aura of Protection can be used multiple times (once per hit) against Eruption Blade because it’s a single attack, not a Combo. Its damage rolls are separate, however meaning that any shield or aura which has a per-round limit (such as Shield Invents) can only be used against a single damage roll. The power Freeze avoids all strikes from this power. You can declare separate defenses against each hit of an Eruption Blade, but parries suffer the usual penalty for attempting to parry a Multiattack, which is applied to all parries made. You do not charge actions prior to using this attack, charges are simply consumed during it. If you do not have enough charges to meet your maximum strike potiential for this attack, you cannot use this attack. Final Ki Attacker does not apply additional damage to the Charge damage, nor does this attack decrease the counter or gain its strike bonus. Statistic Bonuses +5 Mnt, +4 Str, +5 Dex, +4 Stm and +5 Spd</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Wolf School Powers</p> <p>Discharge Multi Punch Combat Teleport Sense Ki Invent Name: Wolf Wind Attack Type: School Cost: 10 Ki &amp; 1 End, per 1d3+1 UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This is a savage Hand to Hand Multiattack in which the user curls their fingers but leaves their palms open, slamming your hands into them repeatedly, which causes a sound similar to that of howling wolves. This attack has a +3 to Strike and deals 1d3+1 punches per level. If this attack deals any damage, the victim is stunned for their next action. Lower Strength modifiers affect this invent as normal.</p> <p>Template: {(1d3+1 per level)x(1d6+Str mod) + Misc mods + Bulk} Stun</p> <p>Invent Name: Soukidan Type: School Cost: 1 End + ( 10 Ki for every 1d8x10 ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This power creates a beachball-sized sphere of white, glowing energy that can be moved with a series of specific hand movements even after it’s been fired. It deals 2d8x10 damage at level 1 and gains 1d8x10 damage every level afterward. Since it’s so easily controlled, it gains +4 to Strike and begins with the Remote addition.
