# Core Statistics
## INT - Intelligence
Despite its name, intelligence doesn't really mean how smart you are, though you're free to roleplay it that way. It represents your mental quickness, how quickly you can notice details and reach critical decisions.
* 'INT/5' is added to your Initiative rolls.
* 'INT/30' Is used to calculate your Actions Per Round.
* 'INT/10' The maximum number of Schools you can know, unless stated otherwise.

## MNT - Mental
Your mental attribute represents how much raw Ki you have and how well you can handle it.
* 'MNT/5' is your bonus to damage and strike rolls with ki attacks.
* 'MNT' is directly used to calculate how much Ki you have, according to Race.

## STR - Strength
Your Strength, quite simply, represents how strong you physically are. It is your brute force.
* 'STR/5' is your bonus to damage rolls with H2H attacks
* 'STR/5' is your modifier to Parry Blast rolls.
* 'STR/10' is your modifier to Sword Damage (Unless STR/10 is higher)
* 'STR' is the primary stat needed for wearing Weighted Clothing.

## DEX - Dexterity
Your Dexterity represents how agile you are and how well your reflexes are.
* 'DEX/5' is your modifier to strike rolls with H2H and Sword strikes.
* 'DEX/5' is your modifier to H2H and Sword parries.
* 'DEX/35' is used to calculate your Actions Per Round.

## STM - Stamina
Your Stamina represents how healthy you are, how much punishment you can take before going down, and your ability to fight of fatigue.
* 'STM' is used to calculate how much HP you have, according to Race.
* 'STM' is used to calculate how much Endurance (END) you have.
* 'STM' is used to calculate how much LP you have, according to Race.

## SPD - Speed
Your Speed represents how fast you are.
* 'SPD/5' is your modifier to all Dodge rolls.
* 'SPD/5' is your modifier to Sword Damage (Unless STR/10 is higher).
* 'SPD/25' is used to calculate your Actions Per Round.
* 'SPD/25' is added to your Initiative rolls.
* 'SPD' is used to calculate how fast you can fly.

## Level
Your level is also used to determine a number of things:
* You gain level x 10 to damage (including TK), as a Misc Mod.
* You gain two powers every level.
* You gain an Invent every fourth level (1, 4, 8, 12, etc.)
* Some races gain Schools, Stats, and increased Hp/Ki mods.


## Hit Points (HP)
This represents your health, how much damage you can take before collapsing and becoming defenseless. The racial modifier and bonus can be found under each race's description, as well as any exceptions. The equation for calculating your HP is:

        **(STM x Racial Modifier) + (Racial Bonus x Level)**

The above shows you how to find your maximum hit points. You also have 'Current hit points', which is your maximum HP minus any damage you've taken. Lost hit points are restored outside of battle at a rate of 5% of your Maximum HP every Neo hour (7 minutes IRL).

When your hit points reach zero, you are conscious, but defenseless, able to talk but unable to do anything else; communicators or items on your person are just out of reach, unless handed to you for some nerfarious reason.  Damage beyond your Hit Points goes to your Life Points.


## Chi or Ki
This is the 'Energy of the universe and life itself'. All living things have some amount of ki in them, but usually (such as a blade of grass or a small insect) it's so little as to be almost negligible. Ki is used to power many special abilities. The racial modifier and bonus can be found under each race's description. The equation for calculating your maximum Ki is:


        **(MNT x Racial Modifier) + (Racial Bonus x Level)**

Like HP, Ki is used or lost in battle and out of battle is restored normally at the same rate Hit Points are, 5% of your maximum every Neo hour out of combat (7 minutes IRL). Getting to 0 Ki has no consequence on your consciousness, but you may feel hungier than usual.


## Endurance - End
This also represents your ability to keep fighting, but relates to physical exhaustion over being pummelled into a Yamcha-sized crator.

Endurance is typically equal to your STM score, but some Races have naturally better Stamina and those exceptions can be found in your Racial information or a Unique you've selected.

If your Endurance ever reaches zero, you are rendered completely unconscious until it recovers back to above 0. You cannot use a move that would take you to negative Endurance, but you can utilize a move that will take you to 0.

## Lifepoints - LP
This is the narrow margin that separates life, from death. From enough damage to knock you out, to a fatal injury or maybe your soul's will to continue to exist. Your LP based off of your STM score, and the exact amount varies according to race.

You only lose LP, after you have run out of HP and damage carries through into it. If your LP ever reaches zero: you are dead. Not big surprise.

If you happen to have Sub-LP, congratulations. You only appear dead and cannot be attacked further.

Sub-LP is what it sounds like; a state of limbo on the edge of death, where you've got something that keeps you from being wiped off this plane of existence. Damage to LP carries into Sub-LP.

Once someone knows you have Sub-LP though, they can try extra hard next time. A race with Sub-LP will recognize another of their Race has it; but be mindful who you tell. It might bite you in the ass.


## Initiative - Init
The first thing you do when combat begins and start a 'Round'. It shows who goes first. But it's not that simple. Next, you determine order of Actions by Dividing your initiative by APR (mentioned next). Init is calculated with the formula:


        **(Int/5 + Spd/25)**

This should give you two numbers; eg Init 21 and APR 3. Divided, that's 7. So, you act on 21, 14 and 7. If your opponent rolled 20 with APR 5. They would act on 20, 15, 10 and 5. With 'Y'ou and O'pponent, it might look like:

Y OO Y O Y O

Because you go first on 21, they got 20 and 15 before your 14, giving them two Actions before your next.

Once this is determined, remember to declare any 'Preround' Powers, Features, Superforms, Equipment, if there's a murderous intent, etc. More info, the better.

Once you've both run out of Actions, a whole minute has passed and a new round begins and with it a new Init roll.

## Actions Per Round - APR
Rounds are broken up by the number of Actions you and your opponent can take, before there's a lull or break in the fighting. If you get multiple Actions in a row, it's often called an 'Action String'. This is where you may choose to use Powers or Abilities that benefit from not being interrupted. The formula to determine your APR is:


        **(INT/30 + DEX/35 + SPD/25)**

Your minimum APR is 3 and each stat cannot give you less than 1 APR, each. For example, if you had 3 APR and had the Very Calm unique; you'd still have 3 APR. But, when you gain enough INT, DEX or SPD to get to 4 APR; if the unique still has -1 APR by the time of reading, you'd still be at 3 APR.

## Power Level - PL
Your power level exists only to gauge how noticeable you are and can be a roundabout way to provide comparison to other people, but doesn't take into account unique abilities or powers. If it's drastically different however, that's a pretty good indicator they're a higher level or have more HP/Ki/Physical Stats.

The higher someone's power level, the more formidable they are--however, it only measures raw ability, not skill or many other factors, so it's only accurate to a certain extent. The sheet will calculate it for you if it's different, but the ORIGINAL baseline is the following formula:

        **((Current HP+Current Ki (including Charging))x(STR+DEX+SPD)x(Current Life Points/Max Life Points))/10**

You still have a powerlevel as long as you have any HP or Ki. So if your at zero ki, but half HP then you still have a powerlevel. This mainly applies if you use a power such as Ki's ending. - If you are knocked into LP, you still have a powerlevel, unless you specifically use a power which states you give off no Powerlevel (e.g., Taisha Charge). - Anyone without any Life Points remaining has no Powerlevel - Therefore if a character is in their Sub-LP, they do not have any Powerlevel.
