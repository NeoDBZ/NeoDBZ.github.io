There are a total of five categories of uniques: Physical, Mental, Personality, Survival and Developmental. All characters have four uniques at most. You may not take two uniques from the same category. One also must be chosen from the developmental tree.

Your uniques are picked at creation and are not normally allowed to be changed after you've picked them and had them added to the roster. There are a few circumstances, however, where you might be allowed to change your uniques.

GM's are pretty reasonable people, just talk to them about your concerns and why you need to change it.

Physical
These uniques are meant to improve the strength, speed, accuracy, and health of a fighter. These uniques primarily increase your ability to withstand damage and your ability to fight with H2H/Swords.

Mental
These uniques represent someone's spiritual chi and the way that they use it in combat. They tend to increase the user's Ki and/or make the user better at fighting with Ki or TK.

Personality
These uniques reflect your character's actions, reactions and decisions. They are in no way restrictive to how you play your character, you don't have to take Brutal Fighting Style in order to play someone who fights dirty. These uniques help your character on a more general level than Mental or Physical uniques.

Survival
These uniques mainly focus on defensive or support abilities. They are used to improve the strength of your auras or your evasiveness.

Developmental
These uniques affect your character's growth and are always most noticeable later on as levels progress. Their effect is usually minimal at the start, but increases as time passes.

## Special Uniques
The two uniques listed here are special; in that they don't fit into any specific category. If you wish to have either (or both) of these uniques, you take each Unique in place of another category; counting for that Categories selection.

### Chosen
This unique represents the hidden potential of a person that is beyond the norms, their capacity to improve and unleash their true limits on what they can achieve. While some will live their entire lives never finding it.

* You gain +5 to all Stats on creation.
* You gain +1 to all stats every 3 levels (3,6,9,etc)
* You gain +1 to your Hp/Ki Modifiers on creation.
* You gain +level x 2 HP/Ki Regen, while in any Superform.

### Enhanced Awareness
When everyone knows how to sense the presence of others, there's nowhere to hide. But You know how your aura can be manipulated far better than any other. People only know as much about you as you let them know.

You can never be affected by the Ki Awareness powers 'Sense Ki', 'Universal Awareness' and 'Sense Path' unless you allow yourself to be.
You can allow people to sense your path but not your powerlevel and vice versa.
The Telekinetic power 'Psionic Surge' still causes you to lose any active Ki Locks against that person; but does not inflict a penalty.
All Ki Awareness powers act as if you were four levels higher than you actually are.
Scouters have their chance to detect you reduced, which stacks with the power Hide Ki. For every level you have, Scouters have a -10% chance to detect you. Using the power 'Increase Powerlevel' negates this penalty however, and still allows Scouters to automatically detect you.
Once per round, you can use your Enhanced Awareness to predict someone's reaction. You declare you're using "Prediction" when you state your attack and they declare their defense. After they declare their defense, you can then declare additional powers you're using with your attack (Superspeeds, Bulking, etc).
Because of the field you project, even Dragon Radars don't work well against you. Reduce the percentage of success from any Dragon Radar that tries to detect any Dragon Balls you carry by 25%.
You may lock onto everyone in a battle using the Ki Awareness power 'Sense Ki'.
You may not take this in place of your Developmental Unique.
