In NeoDBZ, levels are rather important. They provide stats, unlock new powers and abilities, improve defenses and damage. Levels are broken down based on Experience Points, which can be gained by doing a number of things in the game, detailed below.

Remember that activity on the server is logged.

Encounters
Perhaps the simpliest form of XP generation is roleplay, dubbed Encounters. An Encounter with another player first requires you to successfully sense them and head in their direction in whatever way you'd prefer (flight, walking, etc).

Usually players will ask who wishes to roleplay in chat, then arrange something with whoever responds. However, this is not required and you can simply roll your sense or scouter to detect someone and go and find what you detected.

If you fail to detect a person, it means you can't 'feel' the direction a person with power is and thus cannot go and meet them. However, if both participants agree, they can meet you anyway - you just wouldn't know they are a powerful person. Until you successfully roll sense. When meeting in this way; ensure that you have a good reason for picking one person out of a crowd or being in a particular place.

Scenes can be anything, provided it makes sense in the restarts' setting and can be described as anything you want it to be. You could create a large and detailled castle with no mechanical benefits because you don't have a dwelling on Earth, if you wanted - so long as it makes sense or doesn't effect anything beyond its function as a background for your interactions.

Encounters grant you and participants 25 XP per 15 Minutes. The first time you RP for at least one hour during any day, you gain +100 Bonus EXP.

You cannot claim Encounter XP, if you're in a scene where there is not another person also in the Encounter. For example, if your partner began a fight with a third person, you cannot claim Encounter XP even if he fights and roleplays with you, because you're on your own. If a fourth person were to arrive, you could roleplay with them and claim off their participation. You're welcome to roleplay with yourself, but you can't claim XP off it.

For interesting or well-written Encounters, GMs may award Bonus XP that they witness. If you believe that something is worthy of a bonus, you can choose to 'log' the roleplay in a node and send it to a GM. Include timestamps.

Events
Events are a little trickier than Encounters or Fights (detailled below), since they have no reliable XP ammount or frequency, but are usually important for plot developments and character development. Generally speaking; an Event is anything run by a GM. This can be a tournament, a random NPC showing up to talk to someone or a full blown battle between good and evil.

If you wish to run stories and events for other players, you can apply to be a storytelle by contacting a GM.

When an event is forming, usually a GM or ST will warn oocly that one is due at x time. This is not to say that it will definately happen, if their criteria is not met and people are not available or other situations, but that they wish to run something and are asking for interest in attending. Population might be limited in events, so they can handle what is going on.

During fight events, special rules or alternative Fighting may occur that tries to speed up large fights. Please have your posts ready for when your action comes by.

There is no limit to the ammount of Event XP one person can aquire, however GMs and STs should try to involve people who have not had the luxury of being in events frequently, more than players with a high Event XP Total.

Fighting
Perhaps the most common form of experience, is battling another person. Like an encounter, it requires you to find a suitable opponent either by asking in OOC and successfully sensing/scounting them or by simply finding someone IC and asking them if they wish to train with you. Generally training in this way is pre-arranged OOCly between a pair or more, but like all forms of XP generation, is not fixed in this way.

Like an encounter, if you fail to detect your decided opponent, without their permission you cannot go and find them until you successfully sense or scout them. If you're roleplaying prior to the fight, you need to have logged a full hour of consistant Encounter XP to claim it.

If you're new, do not be concerned about taking a long time to decide actions or fight. The only way to learn is to play it, then you'll quickly speed up once you understand what you're doing. Just make sure to warn your opponent that you're new, so that he or she may be able to help you out during the fight or point out mistakes so that you can learn. Spectators should refrain from chiming in where possible.

Be warned, however, because there are different classification of fights and some are indeed, quite deadly! See the "Spoils of War" node supplied further in this section of the PHB for more information. If you are not certain what type of fight you're entering, ask your opponent in OOC. Also be aware that Credits and Items are on your person unless you have a Dwelling with a Safe and record that you have stored them, which can be stolen if you're unconcious. Opponents with a vapourized body cannot be looted.

If you fight a person you have already fought within a 16 hour period, you do not recieve XP from it. If you fight a person who was the last person you fought, regardless of the time apart, you only recieve 50% XP. Fights that you do not gain Experience from, must still be logged and exploitation of this is punishable.

As a side note, if you lose a fight the credits gained do not come from you. So you're not losing money, don't worry.

For good roleplay during fights, GMs may award Bonus XP that they witness. If you believe that something is worthy of a bonus, you can choose to 'log' the fight in a node and send it to a GM. Include timestamps.

No single "team" in a fight may contain more than 3 fighters at one time. A fighter may "tag" in or out, changing who is in that 3v3 lineup inbetween rounds. If you tag out, you may -not- flee the combat unless your opponents all agree to allow you. There are a lot of "what if" situations that arise from this rule, such as what happens during a betrayal. Because any rules to handle these fringe situations would have to be far too detailed and far-reaching to cover every situation, the GMs have the freedom to arbtirate any and all "special cases."

Wearing armor in a fight causes the person's XP to be reduced by 50% of the EXP they should have aquired, after all other reductions are applied. Armor granted by your Race or Uniques does not incure this penalty.

Deathmatches
Anyone may declare a Deathmatch against one or more targets as a Pre-Round action or by taking an action. This declaration of intent is always obvious, whether because of a public announcement or the ferocity of your attacks. Take that moment to milk the RP, then look back here to see what happens.

All participants in the fight do not receive EXP penalties for killing their opponent; or using any powers, invents, statboosters or superforms, regardless of how many rounds the fight has gone on.
The person who declared the Deathmatch gains the following benefits:
+50 EXP and +50 Credits are added to a "Prize Pool" you win if you kill your opponent at the beginning of each round. If you declared as a pre-round action, then the round you declare counts. Otherwise, you must wait until the beginning of the next round to start accruing this bonus.
+50 EXP and +50 Credits for declaring a Deathmatch as a pre-round action in round 1.
No penalty for wearing armor if you declare a Deathmatch as a pre-round action in round 1.
The bonuses and penalties for fighting someone of a higher or lower level are doubled.
If you declare a Deathmatch against a Restricted Race and kill them, you receive +100 XP and +1 Rep.
You receive no experience, credits or reputation at all if you do not successfully kill your target. If your target lives due to Sub-LP, Venguard School, or a similar mechanic then you still get XP and Credits but not Rep. If you abuse this privledge there will be repercussions.
Note that you may declare a Deathmatch against your opponent after they declare one against you to receive the same benefits. If the deathmatch was declared as a pre-round action you may still match them as a pre-round action.

Other Training
Daily Life and Training Days
Your character doesn't hide in some box until a fight or an RP comes along. Your character is highly motivated by real world standards, and keeps improving themselves. Every 24 hours, you gain 100 Credits and 1 Reputation, as well as one of the options listed below:

+1 to one of your Stats. No more than half your bonus from training days may go to one stat, rounded up.
+1 additional Reputation
+200 additional Credits
Learn a School (takes 4 Training Days in a row!)
Learn a Racial Power (takes an amount of Training days spent in a row as listed in the power's entry)
If you create late, you gain training days for the days you were not here.

Experience Training
Even if you can't fight or RP, your character can still gain XP. During this down time, your character will continue to develop their skills, even if only through simple choors or light workouts.

Every 24 hours where your character does not RP or Fight, you can log 400 XP under the Battle Log. If you RP or Fight but earn less than 400 EXP in a 24-hour period you may instead choose to take EXP Training.

At a certain point training alone will become far less advantageous. In game terms, this means any EXP training that is done after you have hit level 10 is halved. Meaning you would gain 200 EXP per 24 hours of inactivity, beyond level 10.

Reputation
This section should be moved to an earlier point in the PHB. For the time being, however, here is a brief explanation!

Reputation is considered an intangible form of currency for some, required to enter high-grade Schools or convince famous smiths to produce fine weaponry for you. It is gained passively as a character progresses daily at a rate of 1 per day, but can be taken through extreme means such as Deathmatches, providing you're successful.

Characters are fully aware of their overall 'Rep' as it grows and thankfully cannot be stolen. This also means it cannot be transferred (though you could buy a sword worth rep and give it to someone). Though it could be tarnished by fleeing a Deathmatch.

Some Tournaments or Events could also effect Reputation positively or negatively, so be aware of this.

Leveling Up; the Quick and Dirty Guide.
Finally, compiled (and updated) into one small, easy to use guide, the step to step basics of leveling up a Neo DBZ character. This is simply a guiding hand of what to do in order, but you're by no means limited by this step by step guide.

1) Stat Points:

Check your racial information and uniques for how many stat points you are allocated upon leveling up. Most races get 5 points, but it doesn't hurt to check as you might get more from a unique or special level that your race enjoys. Once you've allocated all your stats, you can move onto the next part.

2) Powers:

Depending on your racial information, you recieve a number of powers each level up. Without any unique alteration, you're allowed a maximum of half (rounded down) of the powers in each tree. These powers can also be used to purchase Racial Powers, assuming you meet the prerequisties to do so.

3) Invents:

Next, update your personal Invents and School Invents. Some levels might also give you access to additional invents. A level means more points for personal invents to improve and always means more damage or defense!

4) Secondry Attributes:

Each time you level, your HP, LP, End and Ki (amongst other things) tends to improve. Make sure you check that these stats have next been updated. Some races gain HP mods and so on when they level, so look out for those goodies! Also you DO count level 1, for things like resistances etc.

5) Refiguring:

Finally, you double check if any of your rollers have changed as a result of your stat increases. You also recalculate your power level and anything else that might've been changed, such as APR or Init.
