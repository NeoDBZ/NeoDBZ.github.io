All characters must select one of these Fighting Styles during creation. They provide each character with a distinct style of combat that will take time to master.

Each Fighting Style grants powers. After level 1, you have a choice between two powers. You do not need to meet the prerequisits of those powers, but if you have both of them then you do not gain the next power in the tree, like with schools.

In addition to the above, you are given your choice of two special powers at levels 8 and 10. These powers are unique to the Fighting Style and may not be gotten any other way.

Each Fighting Style grants stat bonuses at the listed level. These bonuses are cumulative and stack with the bonuses of previous levels.

You begin with a Fighting Style regardless of your INT, although it -does- count towards your INT/10 limit for learning future schools.

Defensive Fighting Style
Powers: You gain the following powers at the listed levels. Unlike schools, you do not gain a power in a higher category if you already know the listed powers. After level 1, you will always have the option of one of two powers. These powers ignore normal pre-requsites.

Every level up you gain one power from Defensive, Defensive Ki, or Superspeed Power Trees.

At level 8 you may select one of the following Powers. They may not be otherwise learned.

Power Name: Bruiser
Level: X2
Type: Passive
Description: A character with this power has learned how to wear his opponents down more quickly than normal. Any time he deals damage with a basic Hand-To-Hand attack or a power from the Hand-to-Hand power tree, his target loses 1+Level/3 endurance, and level x 5 ki. If the target takes no damage after damage reductions, they lose no endurance or ki. A target may only have this occur to him once per action. This power does not apply to Grapple moves.

Power Name: Hands like Water
Level: X2
Type: Passive
Description: You may attempt a Grab one additional time per round. A character with this power has also learned how turn the opponent's weight and force against them. After a successful Dodge or Hand-to-Hand Parry, you may immediately perform a Grab attempt against the attacker at no cost in APR or END, but it does count against Grab's Uses Per Round.

Select one of the following powers at level 10

Power Name: Typhoon Kick
Level: Z
Type: One
Cost: 4 End
UPR: 1/battle
Description: You perform a powerful spinning kick that knocks the opponent in the air, setting them up for even stronger attacks. This attack has a +3 bonus to strike and deals 1d4x10 damage per level, +(STR+SPD). However, until your opponent's next action all of your attacks against them deal +Levelx10 damage and gain a +2 bonus to strike. The power "Pound" ends this effect, but deals another +Levelx10 damage and stuns the opponent for one action.

Against NPCs who may have an inflated HP to serve as "boss fights," the added damage due to missing HP may be lower, at the staff's discretion.

At level 8 you may select one of the following Powers. They may not be otherwise learned.

Power Name: Chi Overflow
Level: X2
Type: Passive
Description: You may use the power "Megacharge" up to twice per battle. Note that your Megacharge Ki Pool has a maximum of 50% of your maximum Ki, meaning that you will often need to spend Ki before using Megacharge again. Androids instead gain +Levelx10 Ki Regeneration.

Power Name: Power to Shields
Level: X2
Type: Passive
Description: You may spend an additional 5 Ki per level on the powers "Aura of Protection" and "Supreme Aura." You may also use Chi of Fortitude at a reduced cost. When using AoP or Supreme Aura with Chi of Fortitude you pay 50% more Ki, instead of the normal 100% increase.

Note: Chi of Fortitude still costs 2 Endurance to use.


At level 10 you may select one of the following Powers. They may not be otherwise learned.

Power Name: Scattering Shot
Level: Z
Type: One
Cost: 4 END, (50 Ki per Level)
UPR: 1/Battle
Description: You release a slow-moving golden blast that splits up and targets multiple enemies after a few moments. This is a Ki Attack with the Remote and Charging Add-Ons. It benefits from Enlarged Ki Blast and deals 2d8x10 damage per level and targets all enemies. Use a seperate strike roll for all opponents, but only a single damage roll that is applied to anyone that is hit. This attack gains bonus damage in the following situations:

+1% Damage for every 1% of your HP that is missing. This attack gains +Level/2 strike.
+X% Damage based on the highest level critical you are suffering ongoing, non-damage effects from. +10% for Level 1, +25% for level 2, +50% for level 3.
+50% Damage per ally that has been knocked unconcious or killed by an opponent, to a maximum of +100% Damage. Being Unconcious due to using Ki's Ending does not count, but death always does. Splits and Ghetti Clones never count for this purpose.
Template: {(2d8x10 per level + MNT Mod)x(1 + 0.01 per 1% of your HP missing + Critical Bonus + 0.5 per Defeated Ally) + Misc Mods + Charging Bonus + PKU} Note: Make sure the damage roll displays decimals.

Power Name: Death Ball
Level: Z
Type: One
Cost: None
UPR: 1/Battle
Description: You start to form a giant deadly sphere of Ki overhead! Once set in motion, the Ki continues to gain in intensity while you are free to perform other actions. This is a Charging Ki Attack with 0 damage. Releasing it takes an action, after which it will automatically Charge itself on each of your actions, adding 10% of your Maximum Ki to its damage. This leaves you free to perform other actions during your turns, although you may not Charge yourself (whether into this attack or otherwise). This consumes one of your Charges per battle on each of your turns. In the case of Androids, their Ki Regeneration doesn't function while this attack is Charging, but it still adds 10% of their Maximum Ki to the damage per turn. Nothing but detonating the sphere can stop this attack from charging, and the user may still attack, dodge and parry as normal. Even Capture Ball or Dokuken will not stop this sphere from charging! This attack gains a +Level/2+10 bonus to strike, but does not benefit from superspeeds.

The sphere is detonated in the following situations

The user spends an action to throw it down on the battlefield. It deals its damage to all enemies.
The user is rendered unconcious, killed, turned to stone or turned to candy, in which case it detonates harmlessly.
Someone is grappled and thrown into the sphere. Throw's normal effects are replaced with this attack's damage, which is applied only to the unfortunate soul throw into it. The victim gets a Break Attempt (including Flare Break) to dive away from the sphere at the last second, turning it into a normal Throw and preventing the sphere from being detonated. In this case, the detonation may only be Blocked.
The sphere may be attacked. It may not defend itself, but it is immune to all non-damaging effects and the user may use Shields on its behalf. It has Level x 200 HP and Level x 10 Resistance. If the Sphere is "killed" then it detonates, attacking the person who killed it -and- the user, both of whom may only Block the attack (including advanced forms of Block).

Sword Fighting Style
Powers: You gain the following powers at the listed levels. Unlike schools, you do not gain a power in a higher category if you already know the listed powers. After level 1, you will always have the option of one of two powers. These powers ignore the normal pre-requsites.

Every level up you gain one power from Sword, Superspeed, or Ki Body Enhancement Power Trees.


Stats


+10 MNT
+15 DEX
+10 STR
+12 STM
+13 SPD
+8 Points to split between Spd, STM and Dex

At level 8 you may select one of the following Powers. They may not be otherwise learned.

Power Name: Tireless
Level: X2
Type: Passive
Description: A character with this discipline loses no endurance for making a basic sword attack. All his sword powers cost him one less endurance per slash, excluding the sword power Twice. For example, a multi-slash only costs 2 endurance per slash, instead of the normal 3, and using the Thrust power costs him 2 endurance. Additionally, the endurance costs for personal sword invents are halved, rounded up.

Power Name: Harmony Style
Level: X2
Type: Passive
Description: Whenever a character with this power successfuly dodges an attack or successfully parries an attack using the Sword power "Parrying Strike," they may make a Basic Sword Attack against the person who attacked them. This costs 4 END, instead of the normal cost.

At level 10 you may select one of the following Powers. They may not be otherwise learned.

Power Name: Kharmic Strike
Level: Z
Type: One
Cost: 6 End. (15 Ki per level)
UPR: 1/Battle
Description: The opponent performs an attack and in the blink of an eye you are behind them sheathing your sword. You are obviously wounded--but so are they. This power is a special defense that may be declared. When your opponent declares an attack on you, you may declare you're using Kharmic Strike as your reaction, alongside a Block. You take damage normally, and perform a sword counterattack attack that gains a +5 bonus to strike, deals +1d8x10 damage per level and stuns the attacker for one action if it hits. This counterattack happens even if you would die, be rendered unable to attack, or are knocked unconcious from the attack its used against, and it ignores all critical effect penalties. If used against an attack that renders you unconcious or kills you, then all dice in the attack are maximized and the attack becomes Auto-Critical. This only works if the attack itself renders you unconcious or kills you, not if you use a power like Ki's Ending to render yourself unconcious.

Template: {(Sword Damage + STR Mod + 1d8x10 per level) + Misc Mods + Bulk} Stun Vs. Attack that defeats You: {(Maximized Sword Damage + STR Mod +8x10 per level) + Misc Mods + Bulk} Stun / AC

Power Name: Aura Slice
Level: Z
Type: One
Cost: 10 End, 200 Ki
UPR: 1/Battle
Description: A sword attack modified by this add-on is capable of severing the opponent's connection to their shields. Any shields used against this attack may not be used again for the rest of the battle. This add-on is declared alongside Bulk and Superspeeds.

Lone Wolf Style
The lone wolf fighting style is for those who prefer to fight alone. As such you are somewhat stronger and flexible than most. However, you may not teach nor gain the benefits of a guild or personal school. You may learn your own school provided your race gives that option. Furthermore any fight you participate in, your allies gain half experience fighting by your side. Finally if two lone wolves ally, no one on their side gets any experience or reputation.

You get one power per level which must be from Ki Offensive, H2H, or Swords.
