School invents like Kamehameha do not need to be charged up before being fired, and cost nothing extra for not charging them up.

Invent Name: Demon Punch Type: School Cost: 4 End, + ( 10 Ki per 1d8x10 ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This is a quick, powerful jab that catches your opponent off-guard when they move to attack you; enhancing your body with the speed of a demon to strike them first. This power has a +5 to Strike and does 2d8x10 damage, +1d8x10 damage per level after one. At second level it becomes Armor Piercing, At level 6 it becomes Armor Shattering and at level 8 it becomes Flaming.

This invent is unique and is used as a Defensive action. When your opponent declares an attack on you, you declare you're using Demon Punch as your reaction. This causes you to strike at your opponent before their attack goes off, forcing them to defend against your attack first. They can take any defensive action against Demon Punch, but after it's resolved, you can only block their attack - having thrown yourself off balance too much to try and dodge or parry. Perfect Block can not be used after Demon Punch.

Demon Punch can only be used against powers that require a strike roll (ie, you cannot Demon Punch the powers Psionic Surge or Taiyoken, or anything similar)
This power may not be used against itself.

With this power, you can make a Hand to Hand strike be a fixed 20 (plus normal Bonuses) instead of rolling the 1d20. This grants none of the normal bonuses for rolling a 20 and doesn't allow for a critical check, it just alters the d20 to a set number for maximium strike ability. If your strike roll has any other dice roll in it; such as from MCT or MACT, they are automatically maximized as well (4 on the MCT's 1d4, 6 on the MACT's 1d6, etc). This power can't be used on a parry. In splitform, this bonus only applies to the body using it.

Invent Name: Taisha Charge Type: School UPR: 1/Battle Description: This power is a last-ditch defensive technique learned by a warrior to protect themselves after they fall in battle and continues to do so while unconcious. This power automatically activates whenever you receive enough damage to kill you. To your opponent; it has killed you. In reality, the technique is a shield that projects a false image and shrouds the user from detection, creating a 'false body' nearby that otherwise appears to be the real thing. This allows a malicious person all the freedom of mutiliating the corpse without it effecting the real body.

Insted of dying, you are left with 1 LP and give off no power level. You recover once you have 1 HP and the image disappears.

Only people with this invent are capable of spotting the real body; even pointing it out seems to leave others confounded. A subtle crimson aura surrounds a victim using this technique. But it doesn't work more than once, really. Once a person has 'killed' you, they won't make the same mistake twice and by that time they tend to include the immediate area in final attacks.

Notes:

If a race has Sub-LP, then this power activates when they run out of normal LP - effectively saving their Sub-LP from damage.
Being told a person has this technique does not allow you to reconize it or go around it; you either have to have witnessed the person using it or have the technique itself.

Invent Name: Dokuken Type: School Cost: 1 End + ( 5 Ki per level ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: This attack weakens an opponent by infusing them with corrupted Ki, weakening their spirit and diffusing their own energy. This is a Hand to Hand attack which has a +5 to strike and deals no damage - it instead causes a flat loss of 50 Ki per level of the attacker, which bypasses all forms of defenses to achieve. This infection persists for only a short while, preventing the victim from using any Powering Up powers or regenerating any Ki for (level/2) actions based on the attacker's level. Round up for this.

Notes:

If this is used on someone who's charging a ki blst, it does not cause them to lose their attack. They can still fire it on their next action, but if they don't it will dissipate harmlessly.

Invent Name: Eruption Blade Type: School Cost: 2 End + ( 2 Endurance per strike after the first. Every extra hit consumes one of your Charges per battle after the first. ) UPR: 1/2 Rounds Description: You charge a massive amount of energy into your weapon, before unleashing a series of swings that gradually lead into a final, powerful and explosive attack and strike your opponent with it. Upon the final collision, the excessive energy is released as a violent fiery explosion against your target.

You gain 1+level/2.5 (round down) in strikes when using this power, each strike is its own seperate roll. The final attack must hit to gain the true benefit of this manuver. You can only add bulk to the first strike and the first strike may only crit. Crits on other rolls simply autohit and add SP/AP if the sword doesn't already have it.

For every strike before the last (level/2.5) that hits your target, you consume one use of Charge/Echarge/Hicharge (Limited by the powers you know, Megacharge may not be used). This cumulative damage is added to the end of your final attack like bulk. All of your attacks deal normal sword damage. The charges used counts against your per-battle maximum. This attack gains Flaming at level 8 on the final attack.

Template First Strike: {((Sword damage + Str mod) + Misc mods + Bulk} Template Additional Strikes: {((Sword damage + Str mod) + Misc mods} Template Final Strike: {((Sword damage + Str mod) + Misc mods+ Charge}

Notes:

Supreme Aura and Aura of Protection can be used multiple times (once per hit) against Eruption Blade because it's a single attack, not a Combo. Its damage rolls are separate, however meaning that any shield or aura which has a per-round limit (such as Shield Invents) can only be used against a single damage roll.
The power Freeze avoids all strikes from this power.
You can declare separate defenses against each hit of an Eruption Blade, but parries suffer the usual penalty for attempting to parry a Multiattack, which is applied to all parries made.
You do not charge actions prior to using this attack, charges are simply consumed during it. If you do not have enough charges to meet your maximum strike potiential for this attack, you cannot use this attack.
Final Ki Attacker does not apply additional damage to the Charge damage, nor does this attack decrease the counter or gain its strike bonus.
