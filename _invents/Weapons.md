Weapon Inventions
Weapon Attack Inventions function like most sword attacks, though they are heavily modified by the user to produce a desired effect. They can be attacks that cut through any defenses or make your own attacks easier on your body, while slashing up your opponent. To create a Weapon Invention, you decide on the dice type you wish to use. You may not change this choice later, so pick carefully. You must have the Thrust power to make a Sword Invent and you must buy at least one dice, before applying special properties. Remember that unlike other attack invents, you still use your base sword dice. Your attack must also cost a minimum of 1 Endurance.

Points Cost Damage 10 1 End, 5 Ki +1d4 15 1 End, 10 Ki +1d8

Special Abilities
(10 points) Armor Piercing
Increases the End Cost by 5
Increases the Ki Cost by 20% Your attack's damage becomes Armor Piercing, meaning it can penetrate people's armor and physical resilience. Armor Piercing is fully described in Advanced Combat.
(15 points) Shield Piercing
Increases the End Cost by 1 per die
Increases the Ki Cost by 20% Your attack's damage becomes Shield Piercing, meaning it can penetrate people's shields and auras much easier than normal. Shield Piercing is fully described in Advanced Combat.
(50 points) Stunning Attack
Increases the End Cost by 3
Increases the Ki Cost by 20% Your attack now disorients your opponent when it hits them. Unless your opponent prevents all of the damage (or Advanced Blocks), they are stunned for one action. This can not be purchased multiple times.
(10 points) Accuracy
Increases the End cost by 1 per 3 times taken
Increases the Ki Cost by 5% per time taken You practice with your technique to the point of memorizing the motion and speeding up its execution, enabling you to strike faster, leaving them no time to react. You can take this add-on a maximum of 15 times. Each time the upgrade is taken, your invent gains a +1 Strike bonus. The Strike bonus applies only to the last strike in a Multi Attack Invent.
(15 points per die) Ki Infused
Increases the Ki cost of every added die by 5 You can now channel your energy into your attack, enabling you to deal much more damage than normal. The invent damage die (not weapon dice/ki enhance dice) of your attack is now x10 (1d8x10, etc). In addition, all bonuses to Ki damage are added to your invent. This addition costs 15 invent points per damage die your invent has.
Notes:

If you increase the invent dice but do not add enough Ki Enhancement to cover every die, none of them are x10, the normal ki cost from this addon is still in effect, and the entire ki cost of the invent is increased by 50%.
This does not allow for Ki-Strike bonuses to be applied to the attack strike.
This does not allow Races which have damage to "all" to apply this racial twice.
(150 points) Auto Critical
Must have 4d4 or 4d8 damage die to purchase this add-on
Increases the End cost by 1 per die
Increases the Ki Cost by 25%
Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. Your attack is lethal, cutting through those that are foolish enough to get hit by it. Your attack becomes Auto Critical, meaning if it does any damage, it inflicts a level one critical effect. Because it's a Sword, it means the critical effect is applied before damage, making the damage Unpreventable. When you roll to determine the effect of the critical, you add +10 to your d100 roll (which applies only to the level one critical chart).
(250 points) Double Auto Critical
Must have 8d4 or 8d8 damage die to purchase this add-on
Increases the End cost by 2 per die
Increases the Ki cost by 50%
Must have the Auto Critical addon.
Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. Your attack is especially deadly, hacking people apart with a single blow. Your attack becomes Double Auto Critical, meaning if it does any damage, it inflicts a level two critical effect. Because it's a Sword, it means the critical effect is applied before damage, making the damage Unpreventable.
(40 points) Bleeding Cut
Increases the Ki cost by 20% Injuries sustained by your attack have trouble closing, and continue to bleed out long after the attack has been inflicted. Your attack now has the effect of Bleeding, which is fully described in Advanced Combat.
(75 points) Multi-Attack
Increases the End cost by 3 per strike
AC and DAC can not be taken with this add-on With this add-on, you cut your opponent down with a flurry of steel, hacking them apart with a thousand little cuts instead of a single cleaving blow. This adds (level/3) extra strikes to your invent, which are performed before the final blow. A separate strike roll is used for each attack, though they all gain the bonus of one Superspeed and the invent's Accuracy, which is only paid for once. Bulk Damage and the bonus Invent Damage is only applied on the last hit.
(5 points) Light Blade
With this your invent puts less strain on your body, enabling you to fight longer withoug being winded from using your full power. The invent costs 1 less Endurance. This can be purchased an unlimited number of times, but your Invent can not cost less than 1 Endurance.
