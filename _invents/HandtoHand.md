Hand to Hand attack Inventions function like regular attacks, however they tend to be catered heavily towards what the user wishes them to do. They can be attacks that use your allies combined attack to deal devestating hits or utilize a sudden burst of energy to flatten your target. To create a Hand to Hand Invention, you decide on the dice type you wish to use. You may not change this choice later, so pick carefully. Your attack must also cost a minimum of 1 Endurance.

Points End Damage
10 1 every 5 dice 1d4
