### Ambidextrous
You're as skilled with one part of your body as you are with another and don't favor either hand. You can write, kick, punch and shoot from both your arms and legs equally well. This has made you very popular with the ladies.

* You gain +2 to all Strike rolls.
* Any time you spend an Action to attack someone, you may perform an additional basic unarmed attack, basic discharge (not Supreme Discharge!) or basic sword immediately at no additional APR or END cost; Ki costs are paid normally. This 'off-hand' attack may not benefit from Bulks or PKU. This feature can't be applied to attacks made while in a grapple and you may not use the same weapon you used to trigger the free attack. Attacks that do not cost an Action (such as counters), Combos and Invents do not provide an additional free attack.
* If you have a racial weapon (such as Konacks' Sword); you possess an additional one. If your race creates a weapon (such as a Makyo), then you may create two weapons at the same time--either in the same Pre-Round or as part of the same Action, as-is appropriate to the race and for no addtional cost.
* All Critical Hit penalties you experience are halved. If you have the power Ignore Pain, the penalties are a fourth of what they normally are.
* You can use the powers 'Multi Kick' and 'Multi Punch' twice per round each.
* Once per round, you may parry a 'Grab' or a Ki Attack (not Telekinetics) using the powers 'Parrying Strike', 'Hand-to-Hand Parry' or 'Telekinetic Parry'. This costs an additional 3 END ontop of the normal power costs.
