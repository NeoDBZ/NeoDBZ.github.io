Ki Attack Inventions function like most other Ki attacks, but they are usually more focused or carry special properties that, when used during a time of need, can overwhelm an opponent for little cost to the user. They could be attacks that, when fired as a group, combine into a swirling beam of energy or a flurry of individual balls of energy that eventually merge into one massive explosion. To create a Ki Attack Invention, you decide on the dice type you wish to use. You may not change this choice later, so pick carefully. You must have the Discharge power to make a Ki Attack Invent. Attacks always cost 1 Endurance.

15 15 1d8x10

Special Abilities
(50 points) Armor Piercing
Increases the Ki Cost by 25% Your attack's damage becomes Armor Piercing, meaning it can penetrate people's armor and physical resilience. Armor Piercing is fully described in Advanced Combat.
(150 points) Auto Critical
Increases the Ki Cost by 50%
Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. The Ki of your blast becomes volatile, severely injuring those it hits. Your attack becomes Auto Critical, meaning if it does any damage, it inflicts a level one critical effect. Refer to the Combat Chapter for its effects.
(250 points) Double Auto Critical
Increases the Ki Cost by 100%
Must have the Auto Critical addon.
Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. The Ki of your blast becomes extremely volatile, and is easily capable of destroying those it hits. Your attack becomes Double Auto Critical, meaning if it does any damage, it inflicts a level two critical effect. Refer to the Combat Chapter for its effects.
(25 points) Charging
You can now gather ki from the surroundings and infuse your attack with it, allowing you to power up a blast, given enough time. You can use any of the normal Charge powers to add to the damage, except for the power Mega Charge. Instead of adding the Ki to your own ki pool, the ki goes directly into your attack, adding 1 point for every 1 ki you would charge. Androids add double the amount of Ki they would normally regenerate in an action, instead (and don't regenerate on actions spent charging into the attack). There is a limit of your level in actions that may be spent charging a given invent.

(40 points) Increased Charging
Must have the Charging add-on already. This simply makes your Charging more efficient, adding 25 extra damage for each action you charge the attack. This can be purchased an unlimited number of times.
One level of Increased Charging also increases the ammount of actions you can charge a ki invent to your levelx1.5 actions (Round up)
(40 points) Combo Attack
Combo Attacks can not have the Multi-attack add-on used with them. This unique addition to a Ki Attack allows you to combine the energy of your attack with that of another person's, enabling you to create an even more destructive blast of energy to take down an exceptionally tough opponent.
In order to use this add-on, you and up to two allies must all have this add-on. You can each fire your blasts and form a single, more powerful blast. You must have an action after each other, meaning no one acts in-between your actions. You all pay the normal ki cost for your own attacks, plus 4 Endurance.

The person with the highest strike roll uses their strike to determine if it hits, with an additional +5 to the roll. If you hit, roll the damage for all the attacks used, add them together, then add 10% to the total. The attack is considered to be from a single source, thus all of the attacks share each other's special properties (Stun, AP, Remote, etc).

You can not perform a Combo with your own Split form, Cell Jr, Janenba Mini, or Ghetti Clone.

(50 points) Counter
This add-on allows you to enhance your ki attack if you choose to use it to counter, or have your own attack countered, giving you a last bit of oomph to overtime their energy. You can add up to an extra 50 Ki per level, adding 1 damage per point of Ki.

(Variable) Multi-attack
Multi-attacks can not have the AC or DAC add-ons used with them. With this add-on, you can separate your attack into multiple blasts, much like a Multi Fireball, which arc and strike your opponent to inflict heavy damage from multiple sources.
This addition costs 50 Invent Points for every 1d8x10 base damage the attack deals, each time you buy it. It allows you to shoot 1d3+1 blasts per time you buy it, but costs an additional 100 ki per 1d3+1. You can buy this multiple times, up to once per level, but once you buy it the first time, you can not later purchase more base damage. You can not charge Multi-Attack Ki Invents for damage, but you can charge Multi-Attack Ki invents to pay for the cost.

Template: {(1d3+1 per time bought)x(Base Damage + Ki modifier) + misc mods}

(40 points) Range Boost
Increases the Ki Cost by 10% Most Ki attacks are only good for a (relatively) short distance, fighting upon a planet, you can hit anyone within sight range fairly easily, but beyond that and your ki tends to fizzle and dissipate. With this add-on, your attack can be used from space. This add-on can not be used to attack an individual person from space, only to attack the planet itself. For the most part, it's used to destroy planets, but be warned: There tend to be people on most inhabited planets that would stop someone attempting to blow up their home. And the planet it's on.
(50 points) Remote Attack
You can redirect the Ki of your attack even after firing it, allowing you to attack with it again if you miss. You can only redirect your attack once. Remote is fully described in Advanced Combat.

(75 points) Double Remote Attack
Must have the Remote add-on already. Your can redirect the Ki of your attack twice after firing it, allowing you to attack with it again if you miss. This functions just like Remote--it's simply a second Remote, which allows you to do certain things with it, like remoting the attack even after your opponent has used Freeze. Double Remote is fully describe in Advanced Combat.
(50 points) Stunning Attack
Increases the Ki Cost by 20% Your attack now disorients your opponent when it hits them. Unless your opponent prevents all of the damage (or Advanced Blocks), they are stunned for one action. This can not be purchased multiple times.
(10 points) Wide Radius
Increases the Ki Cost by 5% Your Ki blast becomes larger, allowing it to hit an area with greater ease. It makes it easier to hit your opponent (and the surroundings nearby, whether you want to or not). Each time it's purchased it gives you a +1 bonus to your Strike roll, and can be purchased 15 times. The Ki Cost increase applies each time it's taken.
