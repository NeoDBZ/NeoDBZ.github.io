An Invent is a special, personal powerup or attack that has been developed by your own hands to do exactly what you want it to do. Every character has one and continues to improve as time goes on. Examples of a personal invent are ki attacks like Vegeta's Galic Gun, Gokus Kaioken and Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon.

Invents are defined by their 'level', which is the level they are aquired - not your current level. Characters begin with a single invent at level 1 and gain invents every fourth level (4, 8, 12, etc) from then on. Invents can be used once per two rounds (except for Statboosters, which can only be used 1/Battle). This can also be called "Invent Level" to easier differenciate the two meanings.

Invents begin with a base of 30 Invent Points, which can be altered by Uniques or Racial traits. Each level you gain after aquiring the Invent, accrues cumulative points. The next level after obtaining the invent, increases the points by the previous ammount +5.

Base Template: **[(25xlevels you've had the invent)+((2.5xlevels you've had the invent) x (levels you've had the invent+1))]**
