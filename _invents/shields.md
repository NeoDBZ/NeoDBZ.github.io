Shield Invents function like normal Auras that you might have, such as Aura of Protection. However, to create a Shield Invent, you must purchase at least one rank of Shield Level. Unlike Aura of Protection, it does not begin reflexively and so cannot be used after a failed defense until upgraded. You do not need to declare the shield level publically when a shield invent is used. You must have the Aura of Protection power to create a Shield Invent.

Special Abilities
(20 points) Shield Level
This alters the shield level multiplier, which has the effect of reducing more damage for less Ki Cost - making it more efficient. Each shield level stops 1 damage, up to a maximum of Shield level 5. You must have a minimum Shield level of 1 to create a Shield Invent. Template: [shield levelx25xyour level] Damage stopped Template: [25xyour level] Ki Cost

(10 points) Increased Limit
This allows you to reduce more damage using your shield invent, albeit by using more of your energy to do so. For every 10 points spent, you can spend 1 more point of ki per level. This can be purchased an unlimited number of times. Shields begin at 25 ki per level, before taking this upgrade.

(50 points) Reflexive
Increases the Ki cost by 50% This ability means you can use your shield to protect yourself even after you fail your defense (dodge or parry). Handy for people who prefer to avoid damage outright and wish to enjoy a safety net. Template: [limitxyour levelx1.5] Ki Cost
(40 points per Shield Level) SP Resistance
Increases the Ki cost by 25% Your Shield Invent can now stop damage which is specifically meant to pierce shields. Shield Piercing effects no longer bypass the defenses offered by your personal Shield. Template: [limitxyour levelx1.25] Ki Cost
(25 points per Shield Level) Flaring
Your shield is either reflective or bounces back when struck. Whatever the method, when you use your Shield invent to prevent the damage from a Hand to Hand or Sword attack, you can return 20% of the damage you shielded, back to the attacker as Unpreventable damage. This damage cannot be dodged, parried or blocked, as it's an instantaneous return. Even if the Attack was UP, Flaring can be used providing the ki cost for stopping damage (even if no damage is stopped) is paid.
