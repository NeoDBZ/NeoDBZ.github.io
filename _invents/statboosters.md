Statboosters are something perhaps alien to most Dragonball Fans, they can represent a transformation of power that a race might not normally get or a technique such as Kaioken being used. These techniques improve rapidly over time, gaining a snowball effect per level you aquire and at later levels.

To create a Statbooster, you take your invent points and divide them by 7. You have that many stat points to split between your STR, MNT, DEX, STM and SPD (never Int). Androids instead divide their Invent Points by 9. Your highest stat bonus may not be more than 10 points higher than your lowest stat bonus. INT never counts for this purpose.

I.E. If your Statbooster grants +10 MNT and +10 SPD, you need to raise STR, STM and DEX by 1 before you increase MNT or SPD.

Statboosters cost 1 END per 4 points added to your stats.

NOTES ABOUT STATBOOSTERS

- You can only use a Stat Booster once per battle.
- You can not use a Stat Booster preround, only by spending an action.
- You can not raise your INT with a Stat Booster.
- Stat Boosters are not compatible with other Superforms.
- Increases in stats will result in increases to secondary attributes, such as HP, End, Ki, APR, Shield HP, etc. That is handled the same as it is for Superforms.
