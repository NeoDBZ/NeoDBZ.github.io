## Dodorian
Dodorians are large, round, humanoid warriors that have a significant amount of dense fat covering their bodies along with the skeletal and muscular structure needed to support it. They have hairless, thick, pink or red skin. In places where hair would be on a human, Dodorians have sharp spikes growing from their skin instead. They are not known for their intelligence, but are not known for their stupidity either.

Originally from the planet Blue Star, Dodorians are primarily seen serving the Icer race in a military role, such as shock troops or guards, for their entire lives past puberty. Though considered a slave race to the Icers, Dodorians enjoy a "favored" status and are treated more as servants than slaves during the lull between wars. This puts them in the unique place of being hated by those lower in the Blue Star's social structure, and alternately hated or liked by those higher. Most Dodorians develop a cynical, pessimistic personality from this dichotomy, some die from it.

Average Height: 6'8" (203 cm)
Average Weight: 455 pounds (206 kg)
Life Span: 60-150 years.

Interesting Traits: Dodorian skulls are three times denser than a human's skull, very technologically advanced race (second only to humans).

(Phys) Dodorians have small spikes all over their bodies, making them dangerous in close-quarters combat. They use STR/4 for their STR Mod instead of the regular STR/5 for H2H Damage and Parry Blast.

(Ment) Dodorians gain Base Max HP/800 to all of their Strikes. This does not affect Parry! Temporary increases to maximum HP, such as through Superforms or Statboosters, do not affect this.

(Phys) Dodorians have sharp spikes lining their bodies, granting Max Hp/25 damage to Hand-to-Hand and Sword attacks.

(Phys) Dodorians are very hard to tire. Their endurance is equal to STMx2.

(Phys) Dodorians are naturally very tough, gaining STM/4 Resistance.

(Phys) Dodorians have several layers of fat; which protect themselves. They have Natural Armor equal to 35% of their Max HP. This Natural Armor (not their resistance!) stops Ignore Armor and Armor Shattering attacks, as though they were only Armor Piercing. This armor recovers HP out of combat at the same rate as the Dodorian's health.

(Ment) 'Rampage' - This power is automatically obtained at Level 1.
Using the momentum of your weight, you can charge and smash into opponents, throwing incredible force against them as a result. Rampage can be added to any Hand-to-Hand attack, granting a +4 to Strike and adding the Dodorian's STM to damage. When used with a Combo attack, the additional damage applies to the last attack in the Combo, like Bulk. Rampage can be used twice per round and costs 3 End.

Template: (Dice + STR Mod + Misc mods) x Multiplier (if applicable) + STM + Bulk

(Phys) 'Resistance Improvement' - The Dodorian must have the Armor Improvement power and be Level 6 before taking this power.
Their natural toughness improves. Upgrade their racial Resistance from STM/4 to STM/2.
