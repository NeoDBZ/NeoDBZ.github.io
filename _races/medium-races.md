<h2 id="hr1">Dodorian</h2>
Dodorians are large, round, humanoid warriors covered in dense fat and supported by a strong skeletal and muscular structure. Their hairless, thick, pink or red skin is lined with sharp spikes instead of hair. Not known for intelligence or stupidity, Dodorians are primarily seen serving the Icer race as shock troops or guards. Though considered a slave race, they enjoy a "favored" status, treated more as servants between wars. This unique position leads to a cynical, pessimistic personality for most Dodorians.
<br><br>
Average Height: 6'8" (203 cm)<br>
Average Weight: 455 pounds (206 kg)<br>
Life Span: 60-150 years.<br>
Interesting Traits: Dodorian skulls are three times denser than a human's skull, very technologically advanced (second only to humans).<br><br>
Example: Dodoria.<br>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) Dodorians have small spikes all over their bodies, making them dangerous in close-quarters combat. They use STR/4 for their STR Mod instead of the regular STR/5 for Hand-to-Hand Damage and Parry Blast.

- (Ment) Dodorians gain Base Max HP/800 to all of their Strikes. This does not affect Parry! Temporary increases to maximum HP, such as through Superforms or Statboosters, do not affect this.

- (Phys) Dodorians have sharp spikes lining their bodies, granting Max HP/25 damage to Hand-to-Hand and Sword attacks.

- (Phys) Dodorians are very hard to tire. Their endurance is equal to STMx2.

- (Phys) Dodorians are naturally very tough, gaining STM/4 Resistance.

- (Phys) Dodorians have several layers of fat which protect them. They have Natural Armor equal to 35% of their Max HP. This Natural Armor (not their resistance!) stops Ignore Armor and Armor Shattering attacks, as though they were only Armor Piercing. This armor recovers HP out of combat at the same rate as the Dodorian's health.

<br><br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Ment) 'Rampage' - This power is automatically obtained at Level 1.<br>
  Using the momentum of your weight, you can charge and smash into opponents, throwing incredible force against them. Rampage can be added to any Hand-to-Hand attack, granting a +4 to Strike and adding the Dodorian's STM to damage. When used with a Combo attack, the additional damage applies to the last attack in the Combo, like Bulk. Rampage can be used twice per round and costs 3 End.<br>
  Template: (Dice + STR Mod + Misc mods) x Multiplier (if applicable) + STM + Bulk<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Armor Improvement' - The Dodorian must be Level 3 before taking this power.<br>
  Their natural protection improves. Increase the Dodorian's Natural Armor to 50% of their Max HP, instead of 35%.<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Resistance Improvement' - The Dodorian must have the Armor Improvement power and be Level 6 before taking this power.<br>

  Their natural toughness improves. Upgrade their racial Resistance from STM/4 to STM/2.<br>

<h2 id="hr2">Humanoid Dragon</h2>
Like their name implies, Humanoid  Dragons appear much like a human but with various dragon-like, or draconian features. These can be minor, such as a human with wings and a tail. Or, they could look like stout muscular dragon that just happens to walk on its hind claws. Dragons are divided into several breeds, which can alter their appearance or techniques even further. This makes them a varied and dangerous creature to encounter.<BR><BR>
Average Height: 5'6" - 12' (167-365 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 200-900 pounds (90-408 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 200 years.<BR><BR>
Interesting Traits: Traditionally following their ancestry, Reptilian or Draconian Features. Extreme Variation in Appearance.<BR><BR>
Examples: Icarus, King Ghidorah, etc<br><br>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<BR><BR>

- (Phys) Humanoid Dragons are tied to one of the fundamental forces of the Universe: Air, Celestial, Earth, Fire, Metal, Shadow, Water, or Wood. Select one of these forces at creation.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) Humanoid Dragons have wings, which lets them start with the 'Basic Flight' power for free and do not have to pay Ki when using 'Basic Flight'<BR><BR>
- (Ment) Humanoid Dragons can easily wreathe themselves in their element at will. They gain the 'Damaging Aura' power for free and it's damage multiplier is 20%, instead of 10%.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) Humanoid Dragons are hard to tire; Their endurance is equal to STMx1.5.<BR><BR>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<BR><BR>

- (Ment) 'Embrace the Elements' - This power is automatically earned at Level 1.<br> Your element rages around you, suffusing your form and rampaging across the landscape. Using this power is an action that costs 50 Ki and 2 END. Everyone who is not a Humanoid Dragon of the same element loses 2% of their current HP (rounded up) and 2 END, ignoring any reductions. The Humanoid Dragon's H2H attacks receive their Max Ki/25 as bonus Bulk damage for the rest of the round. Multiple uses of this power stack the bonus damage. Other forms of Bulk damage may be stacked with this bonus damage. Each Element has an additional effect when Embrace the Elements is used.BR><BR><BR>
- (Phys) 'Breath of the Dragon' - This power may be obtained at Level 5.<br> Deep in the chest of every Humanoid Dragon lies a heart born of their element and is infused with its power. A Humanoid Dragon may call upon this power up to Once every two Rounds, at the cost of 15 Ki and 1 End per level. It deals 1d6x10 AP damage per level that Stuns if the target takes HP damage. This counts as a H2H attack for strike and what addons can be used with it (i.e. Shield Piercing Charge, CQM, Damaging Aura, Bulk, etc). The opponent however, defends against the attack as though it were a Ki Attack. This power has the Charging Add On, as though it were a Ki Invent and gains the Increased Charging add-on on every level-up. Each Element has its own unique flavour to add, too.<BR><BR>Template: (1d6 x 10 per Level + STR Mod + Misc Mods ) \* multiplier (if applicable) + Bulk + Charge + 25 x Level-1 x Actions Charged. AP/Stun

#### -=( Air )=-<BR>

Air, can you catch it, can you hold it, can you even see it? Much like their namesake, the Air Dragonkin are here one minute, gone the next. Over hills, inside valleys, behind you whispering in your ear, or just off the horizon; they are a proud, nomadic people, who greatly value individuality and freedom. They are most comfortable in great, wide-open areas, which are conductive to their flying ability and their love of personal space. Unlike the other clans, they tend to spend their entire lives alone, perhaps in distant contact with friends and family. The only exception to their self-imposed wandering is when they find a mate, which they tend to stick around until the hatchling is born. Then, they are on their own. If you happen to see one gliding gracefully in the atmosphere, watch. For, you never know if you will ever again see such a beautiful creature across the skies.<br>

- Feature: Air is ever elusive and just out of grasp. Gain the 'Multi-Combat Teleport' power for free. After successfully using 'Multi-Combat Teleport' on a Strike roll that hits, immediately refund its Use Per Round.<br><br>
- Breath: Air is in eternal cycle, in and out of all living things. Those hit by the elemental purity of air can't increase their HP, Ki, or END for the rest of the round, for example from Regen, Charging or Mini-Superforms.<br><br>
- Embrace: Air sets the currents in the sky as wind rampages across the battlefield. Any time an Air Dragon successfully Dodges an attack, they may use Embrace the Elements without it consuming an APR. This may not be combined with other counterattack options.<br><br>

#### -=( Celestial )=-<br>

The Celestial Dragons are not named for an inane ability to live in space vacuum. The nickname of Space Kin comes from a bastardization of their language, that of the very stars. They live in a culture that clings to philosophy, science, and astrology to form the basis of their own religion. The stars link all worlds together, through their light and from the forces of gravity. They believe life and death behave in a similar fashion. We are all linked. We are all one. Every action affects everyone else. The development of their society has led to many hours of meditation on the nature of existence. Upon their awakening to the higher forms of war in Chi usage, they found it came easily as breathing to their keen minds and bountiful spirits. They tend to cluster in small communities around a temple, living simple lives much like that of simple villagers.<br><br>

- Feature: Celestial is cosmic forces, guiding the natural order of the other elements on the planets. You may apply the powers 'Damaging Aura' and 'Bruiser' to their Ki Offense Powers, 'Breath of the Dragon', and Ki Invents.<br><br>
- Breath: Celestial is planets and stars, casting the whole of heaven in their glow. It cannot be contained and, like the sun and the moon, rises again. The Breath attack targets all opponents in the battle. It counts as a Ki Attack, using your Ki Attack modifiers and for determining what addons work on it. The attack gains the Remote add-on.<br><br>
- Embrace: Uncountable points of light hang in the sky, rampaging across the land in a small nova or galaxy. The bonus damage added by 'Embrace' applies to Ki attacks, although it counts as (and does not stack with) damage added from PKU.<br><br>

#### -=( Earth )=-<BR>

The Earth Dragonkind are the most numerous of all dragon types. Perhaps, this is due to their hardiness. Perhaps, it is their knack for foraging and finding bountiful lands. They live in clans. Each family often has a dozen or more children, which live together for almost their entire lives. They are a primal creature, trusting their instincts that rarely lead them astray to survive in worlds that grow harsher by the generation. Should the apocalypse come, Earth Dragons and cockroaches will bear witness to the mass extinctions. Despite their large clans, they tend to be rarely seen, often living in the wilds in an almost caveman existence.<BR><br>

- Feature: Vast and strong, ever changing yet unbowed. You may use STM in place of STR for all grapple checks and for purposes of calculating the damage of Grapple only attacks (although you still use your STR Mod when appropriate). Whenever you enter a Grapple with someone, whether you started it or not, you may immediately take one action within the grapple without it costing APR. If one Earth Humanoid Dragon grabs another Earth Humanoid Dragon, the attacker gets their free action first.<BR><BR>
- Breath: The foundation of life, it is the element that draws all other things near and defines the context in which they hang. Someone hit with the purity of earth is encased in Rock. Targets hit by this Breath are 'Grounded' until the end of the Round. Grounded individuals may not fly or use Superspeed powers above level 2, except Graceful.<br><br>
- Embrace: Dominating the field, and you've become the intruder rampaging across it, stuck to roiling earth. Adds HP/25 instead of Ki/25 to their damage rolls for the rest of the Round and the bonus applies to Grapple-only attacks.<br><br>

#### -=( Fire )=-<BR>

Bitterness is like a cancer. It eats away the host. But, passion is like fire. It burns all the rot away to leave only the ashes. The Fire Dragonkin are a passionate people. There are no half measures. Regardless of their moral standing, they act. Damn everything else. Their favorite areas to settle are dormant volcanoes, preferring the heat to all other climates. The abundance of metal and obsidian is pleasing to them. Both are vital to their art and warfare. Although hot-tempered, no one can accuse this proud race of being incompetent. They are trained from an early age in the arts of war. There are no families. There is the whole, the people. In the rare case of individuality, one justifies it by accomplishing their 'dreams' or ambitions.<BR>

- Feature: The element of consumption and transformation. Begin with the 'Bruiser' power. When the 'Bruiser' power causes someone to lose Ki, they lose an equal amount of HP (ignoring reductions)<BR><BR>
- Breath: The element of generosity, using its fuel to fill the universe with warmth. Yet, too much overwhelms that which it touches and thus converting their vital essence to fuel. Those being damaged might find their souls ignited, burned from within by their own passion. Damage dealt to the target, after all reductions, is also subtracted from their Ki.<br><br>
- Embrace: Heat roils across the battlefield, sapping energy and returning it as blistering fire. Targets effected by this Embrace also lose 1% of their current Ki (rounded up).<br><br>

#### -=( Metal )=-<BR>

Injustice boils in men's hearts as does steel in its cauldron, ready to pour forth, white hot, in the fullness of time. Metals are a good way to describe these dragonfolk. They can be brittle as iron, pretty as copper, or the more rare but feared true steel. Rivals of the Fire Clans over territory, Metal is appropriate for their immensely tough hide and unyielding determination. They tend to be quite pragmatic, using logic and reason where others would rely on blind faith. They tend to be in tight-knit familial or friend-driven groups, established through hard-won trust. The hard-won respect and trust of a Metal Dragon can be truly priceless beyond measure.<BR><BR>

- Feature: Forged in the hardship of struggle, in the furnace of genius. None but the strongest obstacle may stop it. You may make your attacks AP, or if they were already AP, make them AS, at no additional cost.<BR><BR>
- Breath: The element of division. Those struck by the purity of metal find themselves severed from their protections. Opponents hit by the breath attack lose their current Resistance, Natural Armor and Armor until the rest of the round, after calculating damage.<BR><BR>
- Embrace: The element of protection. As metal shards rampage across the battlefield, they also form another layer of protective scales around the Humanoid Dragon. Your Resistance improves by 2xLevel until the end of the Round. Multiple applications stack.<br><br>

#### -=( Shadow )=-<BR>

The very substance of ambition is as elusive as the Shadow and just as dangerous. The Dragonkin of the Shadow have embraced their nature like all others, always watching from the darkness. Over time, they have learned the secrets of others: where their power comes from and how to steal their advantages away through the use of cunning. A knife's edge poised at the heart of their enemies and conquered victims, the slippery shadowflight of dragonoids is one to be measured with caution. They tend to live among other races, manipulating them, occassionally taking them on as minions to serve them. Oddly enough, they tend to be protective of their subordinates, not seeing them as people but cherished prize possessions that they cling to hard, and brutally punish those that would damage something out of their collections.<BR>

- Feature: The element of obscurity necessarily established by all things. You can never be affected by the Ki Awareness powers 'Sense Ki', 'Universal Awareness' and 'Sense Path' unless you allow themself to be. Scouters and Androids have a -10% per Level chance to sense them. You begin with the power 'Taiyoken'.<BR><BR>
- Breath: The element of denial, blocking people from warmth and light. Those hit are swallowed by darkness, denying themselves their highest self. Anyone hit by your breath attack is denied the benefits of any Superform or Statbooster until the end of the Round.<BR><BR>
- Embrace: Darkness washes over the battlefield, enveloping it in cold embrace. Every time an individual is effected by your Embrace; track the number of times per person and multiply that value by 5. When someone rolls a d20 equal to or less than their value, the Action automatically fails. Then half the Embrace's value for that person. This Embrace value is reset between Rounds. Yarkons are immune to this feature, as creatures of darkness themselves. Powers that do not roll a d20, such as Freeze, are not effected by Shadow Embrace. Anything that grants a reroll may still be used after failing.<br><br>

#### -=( Water )=-<BR>

Rivers, ponds, lakes, streams; all contain water, but have different names. Yet just as all idealogy, they contain truths. The Water Dragonkin earned their name for their love of aquatic environments. They spend as much time swimming as flying. This did not begin from ideology or philosophy. But rather, their ancestors developed the habit as a way of cooling down after a long flight or battle. They are masters of change, able to adapt to almost any situation with very little complaint. They flow like their cherished liquids, able to disrupt another's stance and recovery just in time to prevent a disastrous assault from taking their life.<BR>

- Feature: The element of flowing through the path of least resistance. When making a Telekinetic Attack, you may use H2H strike modifiers, rather than Ki Strike modifiers, as well as add the effects of the powers 'Bruiser', 'Damaging Aura' and half of damage bonuses to H2H attacks (Ki Body Enhance Powers still can not modify a Telekinetic Attack). Finally, gain the power 'Telekinetic Enhancement' for free.<BR><BR>
- Breath: The element of erosion, shaping the ground like a sculptor's chisel. Those facing this element face the inevitability of power that shaped canyons. Superspeeds may not be used for or against this breath attack and the attack may not be parried. Someone hit by the attack becomes 'Engulfed' for up to 1+(Level/5) Actions in place of being Stunned. Being Engulfed functions as 'Capture Ball', except that they may spend an action to try and Break out, as if it were a grapple. The Water Humanoid Dragon uses MNT in place of STR for this Break check.<BR><BR>
- Embrace: Tsunamis rampage across the battlefields, sweeping everything up in a torrent and crushing it with phenomenal pressure. Their 'Psychic Aura' or 'Solid Aura' recovers MNT HP every time 'Embrace' is used. Further, 'Psionic Surge' gains a stacking +5% bonus to its success rate until the end of the Round.<BR><BR>

#### -=( Wood )=-<BR>

There are always flowers for those that wish to see them. Too oft, the powerful crush them under their heels in their struggles for dominance. The Wood Dragonoids are a nomadic, spiritual people who cross the stars to heal scars. They lovingly craft garden worlds out of ruins, turning them into a veritable paradise. They have been rewarded for their centuries of deep connection to nature. They are linked to life itself. To oppose a Wood Dragonkin is to oppose nature and life itself. These dragonoids tend to have a warm, loving nature, tempered with caution. They are slow to act. But once stirred, they act surely. They are frequently besmirched for their lack of material possessions. But to a Wood Dragonkind who appreciates the beauty and mortality of life; they are already the richest of the souls on the mortal realm. For, they have the riches of nature's bounty within their very essence and under their guard.<BR><BR>

- Feature: The element of life and beauty, ever triumphing over adversity. Regen Levelx2 HP and Ki, as well as 1 End on each of their turns.<BR><BR>
- Breath: The element of growth and ever expanding needs. Those damaged by this breath become the seedbed for rampant and untamed life growing from their own body. For the rest of the round after being damaged by this Breath attack, the target takes an additional 10% of the damage the Breath dealt (post reductions) again as UP/AS when the Wood Humanoid Dragon has an action. This extra damage is an automatic hit, but is reduceable.<br><br>
- Embrace: Plants rapidly grow, lash out and die in an eternal cycle across the battlefield. The Wood Humanoid Dragon's HP and Ki regeneration increases by their Levelx2 until the end of the Round. Multiple applications of this Power stack.<br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="hr3">Jeice-jin</h2>

The Jeice-jin society closely resembles the society of Humans of Earth with a few key differences. At some point in their racial development, they were required to fight to keep their planet from being invaded. They quickly became experts in two things that they'd need to survive the wars: Ki and Speed. This development has helped them to survive to this day. However, having only recently been exposed to the galaxy outside their planet; the race is young, mentally, in the eyes of the Universe. Shocked to discover that they were not the supreme beings in their galaxy, they often use ego to hide from their imperfection and weakness. As a result, they are usually blindsided when encountering strength and progress in other fighters that they encounter.<br><br>
Ego became a mechanism of defense. Perhaps, a tool used by their people. To ease the mental transition between being supreme. To being one of many other average races. Initially, they were not a haughty people. Some of the Jeice-jin remain relaxed as they had been before the discovery of the Universe beyond their purple skies. While, others took things a different direction. Many of the Jeice fighters began reaching for power beyond the stars and left home in search of new strength and new terrain to explore. Despite the galactic immaturity, the Jeice-jin have quickly made a name for themselves with their ability to control and use Ki as well as speed. While they are not physically imposing, it is unwise to take your eyes off of a Jeice, if he or she is angered. However, because of the same galactic immaturity; Jeice are easily offended when they are misunderstood or taken by surprise.<br><br>
Human in appearance. Their skin color ranges the warm end of the color spectrum from red to gold. With hair often being white or a variation of white (warm white, cool white, off-white, pearl white, etc.), always white in some form. They come in a variety of builds, just like humans. Pinning just one body type on the race would be a dishonest representation of them.<br><br>
Average Height: 5' - 5'10" (152-177 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 80-160 pounds (36-72 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 70 years.<BR><br>
Interesting Traits: Most of the Jeice-jin Home Planet embodies a twisted beach environment. It's very tropical, only with red waters and purple skies that change based on weather condition. Also, no one knows the location except for the Jeice-jin. Though, an Icer found it many millenia ago and took a portion of their race to be used as slaves. Until relatively recent, these slave Jeice-jin were the only ones known in the Universe. The Icer plucked up an entire city, which became a ghost town for the Jeice-jin.<br><br>
Example: Jeice.

<br>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) Jeice-jin are exceptionally fast, gaining +2 to all Strike and Dodge rolls.<br><br>
- (Ment) Jeice-jin undergo arduous mental training from a young age to strengthen their minds and to focus their energy into a single place, when using large attacks. They may add the Charging Add-On to any of their non-Multi, non-Combo Ki Offense Powers. This functions like charging an Invent, except that you may not Charge and fire as part of the same action and you don't need to charge a minimum of twice. When using this feature, this Charged damage replaces PKU.<br><br>
- (Ment) Jeice-jin have an unusual mastery of Ki. On their turn, up to 2+(Level/4) times per round, but no more than once per action; they may perform the Charge, Enhanced Charge, or High Charge action (including charging into an attack) without it taking up that action or costing END.<br><br>
- (Ment) Jeice-jin have a great mastery of Ki, granting Max Ki/25 damage to Ki attacks (Charging does not affect this). When charging into attacks, this bonus damage is multiplied by the number of actions spent charging.<br><br>
- (Ment) Jeice-jin gain their Max Ki/750 as a bonus to all Dodge rolls. Temporary increases to maximum Ki, such as through superforms or stat boosters, does not affect this. <br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Ment) 'Sonic Blast' - This power is automatically obtained at Level 1.<br> Jeice-jin can unleash a high-pitched scream to damage their foes. It is a Ki attack that deals 2d6x10 damage per 25 Ki spent, with a max of 25 Ki per Level, but does not gain additional damage from PKU or anything else that gives additional damage based on Ki or HP. This damage is considered Unpreventable and Ignores Armor. This attack can only be used once every two rounds and can not be parried or countered. This may not be charged via the Jeice-jin's racial feature.<br><br>Template: (2d6 x 10 per Level + MNT Mod + Misc Mods ) x multiplier (if applicable) . UP/IA<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Flying Dodge' - The Jeice-jin must be Level 3 before taking this power.<br> Flying Dodge allows the Jeice-jin to Dodge attacks, even while they're charging Ki into an attack. Although, they must be flying to do so.

<h2 id="hr4">Konackan</h2>
Konackans are a race of virtuous warriors who dedicate wholly to any cause that the Kaioshins deem fit for them. Whatever they choose, they devote themselves to fully. They have pointed ears and spiky, brightly colored hair. The Konackans are a religious race that strongly adhere to beliefs in, and worshiping of, the Kaioshin. No particular Kaioshin are overly favored by the Konackans. There is an, almost, even split for which Paths are followed. Most are musically inclined. It is not uncommon to hear interweaving melodies as one walks through the streets in their cities. As a people, they are mostly peaceful and do not war with another. They are not overtly distrusting of strangers. However, they are protective of their planet. Non-Konackans visitors are punished harshly if they commit any serious crimes. Most are usually banished from the planet and firmly told to never return. But, death sentences are considered an appropriate punishment for severe transgressions.<br><br>
Average Height: 5'6" (167 cm)<br>
Average Weight: 130 pounds (58 kg)<br>
Life Span: 1,200-1,500 years.<br><br>
Interesting Traits: Each Konackan is given a musical instrument early in life. Especially pointy ears. No known Konackan has worshiped anything other than a Kaioshin.<br><br>
Example: Tapion.

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Ment) All Konackan warriors have a single Spiritual Weapon. It is an especially well-crafted weapon with +2 to Strike rolls and deals 2d10 per the Konackan's Level. It starts as Shield Piercing and becomes Armor Piercing at Level 8. It becomes Armor Shattering at Level 12. It can be Ki Enhanced at no additional cost.<br> If the weapon is ever forcefully taken from you or picked up without permission, it deals its damage to the thief for each of their actions. The weapon can only be released by giving it back to its original owner, while sincerely speaking an apology for offending the Gods (The holder is aware of this criteria). The blade of a dead Konackan gives off a warning aura and if picked up, it may never be put down short of cutting off the arm holding it. Konackans always know the direction (but not distance) of their Spiritual Weapon, even if it's lightyears away.<br><br>
- (Ment) Konackans are masters of their blades, granting Max Ki/25 damage to H2H and Sword attacks (Charging does not affect this),<br><br>
- (Phys) Konackans can go for five days without sleep and suffer no adverse effects. Their endurance is equal to STMx2.<br><br>
- (Ment) Konackans begin with two extra powers from the Sword tree.<br><br>
- (Ment) Konackans use their DEX/4 instead of DEX/5 as their modifier to all Sword Strikes.<br><br>
- (Ment) Any Invents created by a Konackan that are Sword Invents, begin with 40 base Invent points instead of 30.<br><br>
- (Ment) Every Konackan has a unique Sword attack. It is considered a Sword Invent and follows its rules. It begins with 20 Invent points, which is not changed by the Konackan's racial feature. It is a special attack that is usable once every two rounds and follows the normal rules for personal Invents. This attack does not benefit from any increased invent points from Uniques.<br> Template: (15xLevel+2.5xLevelx(Level+1)) Invent Points<br><br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Ment) 'Dragon Fist' - The Konackan must be Level 5 before taking this power.<br> Konacks can channel the power of a great, golden Celestial Dragon through their attack to crash into their target. This power modifies a Basic Sword attack or the 'Uppercut' Basic Attack. The affected attack gains AS, UP, AC, and deals The weapon's dice, +1d8x10 damage per Level. This costs 25 Ki and 1 End per +1d8x10 damage added and may only be used once per two rounds. <br><br> When a Konackan reaches Level 12, they may teach this power to up to two other people if they are level 8 or higher. Teaching this power takes two Neo weeks. During which time, neither person may fight or train. The person taught this technique can not teach it to anyone.<br><br>

<h2 id="hr5">Makyosei-jin</h2>
Makyosei-jin, often simply referred to as Makyo, are a rare breed whose true origin is shrouded in mystery. While the majority would agree that they are in fact demons who have escaped from Hell, others believe they are, in fact, just another alien race that has obtained the title of demons through their ruthless ways. While coming in many forms, shapes, and sizes; the Makyo all have one thing in common: their sheer brutality. They radiate evil. Even those who walk a lighter path still manage to strike fear into their enemies, causing some to scatter and others to react a bit slower than usual. While the average Makyo will take a more hands-on approach when faced with a problem, there are a select few out there who would rather work from the shadows and manipulate those for the sheer pleasure of watching chaos spread. Though normally short in stature, those who encounter them speak tales of a terrifying ability to drastically alter their shape. Most have an unusual color of hair, skin or eyes, but could also have horns.<br><br>
Average Height: 5'5" (165 cm) (Base Form), 8'8" (264 cm) (IGF)<br>
Average Weight: 260 pounds (117 kg) (Base Form), 900 pounds (408 kg) (IGF)<br>
Life Span: 200-250 years.<br><br>
Interesting Traits: Red Eyes. Able to make weapons from their body. In the Neoverse, there is a planet, known as the Makyo Star, said to be the home of the Makyo. When they are near it, their strength drastically increases. Though no one lives on it and few ever see it, rumors have it that the forces of Hell cause it to move.<br><br>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Ment) Makyosei-jin gain Max Hp/25 damage to H2H and Sword attacks.<br><br>
- (Phys) Makyosei-jin may use weapons easier than others. As such, all sword attacks have their END cost reduced by 1 per swing of the weapon (that is, twice would reduce its cost by 2, a multi-slash that attacks four times would reduce the total END cost by 4, etc). This stacks with Tireless and other effects, to a minimum cost of 0 END.<br><br>
- (Phys) Makyosei-jin may create weapons (such as a sword, axe, or staff) from their bodies at will. They are always considered to be wielding every basic weapon simultaneously, and may use any basic weapon for any action at any time. They still may only use one weapon for a single action. Weapons they create may not be shared.<br><br>
- (Phys) Makyosei-jin are naturally intimidating due to their demonic nature, gaining a +1 to Initiative rolls for every two levels gained, rounded up

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) 'Growth Form' - The Makyosei-jin must be Level 5 before taking this power.<br> The Makyosei-jin can now transform into a larger form, which takes an action, costing 20% of your maximum Base End and grants the following bonuses:
- +30% to base STR
- +10% to base SPD<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Demonic Strength' - The Makyosei-jin must be Level 7 before taking this power.<br> Makyosei-jin may channel the their demonic heritage into raw power by taking an action and spending 50 Ki and 2 END. For the rest of the round (including the action where they activated this power). All of their H2H and Sword attacks become AP/SP and add the user's STR/3 as bonus Misc Mod damage. If the user wishes to deactivate Demonic Strength early, then they must spend an action to do so (after spending the normal cost). For each action they use this ability, it costs them a further 50 Ki and 2 END.<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Improved Growth Form' - The Makyosei-jin must have the Growth Form power and be Level 10 before taking this power.<br> The Makyosei-jin gains a second form, which takes an action to activate while in Growth Form and 30% of your Maximum Base End. Growth Form's bonuses are replaced with the following bonuses:
- +50% to base STR

- (Phys) 'Master Form' - This power is automatically obtained at Level 12.<br> 'Growth Form' no longer costs End to transform, has no EXP penalty, and can be used as a pre-round Action, while 'Improved Growth Form' adds +1 to HP and Ki modifiers.

<h2 id="hr6">Namekian</h2>
The Nameks, also commonly known as Namekians or Nameksei-jin, are a race from planet Namek. They are humanoid with insect/reptilian/slug-like characteristics, including green skin, pointed ears, pink patches on their limbs, and antennae. They are known throughout the Universe as a predominately peaceful race. But, Nameks are more aptly described as philosophical warriors, being broadly divided into two classes: fighters and healers. Years before obtaining intergalactic travel, the Nameks were invaded by forces at war. Many of their people died while peacefully protesting the invasion.<br><br>
Namekians do not have genders, reproducing asexually by spitting out an egg, which usually shortens their lifespan. Despite not having a gender, they possess relatively masculine physiques. Usually, the sons are not a genetic copy of the father. Rather, the father has some control over what type of child will be formed. This can even result in the offspring being mutated to such an extent so as to not even resemble others of their species. It is said that the race was initially created by a powerful wyrm dragon. As a result, this extremely spiritual race often worships the Eternal Dragons rather than the typical devotion to a Kaioshin. Though, respect towards all Gods is common.<br><br>
Average Height: 5'11" (180 cm)<br>
Average Weight: 200 pounds (90 kg)<br>
Life Span: 250-300 years.<br><br>
Interesting Traits: Asexual, purple blood, plant-like, only drink water, and eat trees grown only on their homeworld (for pleasure, not subsistence).<br><br>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) Namekians have incredibly keen hearing, granting them a +2 to Initiative rolls and +1 APR.<br><br>
- (Phys) Namekians are capable of incredible regeneration. They Regen Levelx6 HP and Ki, 1 END, and Level in LP. By suspending Regeneration for that action, they may reduce a Critical to the same result a chart lower or heal a level 1 Critical completely.<br><br>
- (Phys) A Namekian's regenerative ability can keep them from dying. Being beheaded is a Triple Critical on each limb and torso instead of death and they have Sub-LP equal to Levelx150. Only other Namekians know that only targeting the head with a Ki attack will kill another Namekian; though coming back from the dead may hint that a person needs to _try harder next time_.<br><br>
- (Phys) A Namekian can split into two separate beings to hate yourself twice as much; see 'Permanently Splitting' <br><br>
- (Ment) A Namekian can permanently fuse with another Namekian to improve their power. One Namekian becomes the dominant personality, while the other Namekian effectively dies; merely a voice in the Dominant's head until it fades. See 'Namekian Fusion'.

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) 'Namekian Bulked Form' - This Power may be learned at level 1.<br> A Namek can alter their regeneration, causing it to suddenly build on and maintain a tremendous amount of muscle mass instead of rejuvenating their bodies. This provides the following changes:
- Their HP and Ki Regeneration is reduced by Levelx6, and END regeneration is reduced by 1 until the superform is deactivated.
- This form has no XP penalty.<br><br>
- (Ment) 'Clothesbeam!' - A Namek may learn this power at level 1.<br> Namekians can modulate their Ki to create simple clothes and tools. Not Technological items. Cosmetic items last forever, but items with an effect only retain their effect for the combat or Event they are made for. Making an item takes an action and costs 1 Ki per 1 Credit the item costs. Items may be created such that a target is wearing or wielding them immediately, and may replace existing items. This power only works on someone who is willing or Defenseless.<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Mystic Attack' - The Namek must be Level 2 before taking this power.<br> The Namekian may now stretch his fiber-like limbs beyond their normal capacity! The Namekian may Remote Hand to H2H Attacks. This costs the attack's original END cost and 50 Ki.<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Enhanced Healing' - The Namek must be Level 3 before taking this power.<br> The Namekian may spend an Action focusing on their recovery. This doubles their total HP, Ki and END Regen for that action. Alternatively, they can Regen the normal amount while also downgrading a Critical, or they can not Regen and instead downgrade two criticals (including the same critical twice). Can be used while Stunned or unable to act. Out of Combat, this doubles the bonus healing from a Namek's regeneration. <br><br>
- (Ment) 'Special Trees' - The Namek must be level 5 before taking this power.<br> Namekians can grow little trees with healing powers! Up to 1+(Level/5) trees in any environment--even deep space, because they're fueled by the loving bond shared between Namek and tree. Each tree can feed a hundred people per day and one special fruit can be harvested. A tree only provides one special fruit and will not produce another til the last one was eaten or destroyed. The fruit will rot if it's away from its owner for more than a Neo Week and it takes a Neo Week for a new one to grow after the fruit has been eaten or destroyed. Consuming a fruit takes an Action and can be done pre-round, it restores 10% Maximum HP, Ki and End.<br><br>
- (Ment) 'Unlock Potential' - The Namek must be level 6 before taking this power.<br> The Namekian can unlock the potential stored in their cells and their heritage. This happens either through personal discovery or under the tutelage of a Guru that unlocks it. This is a Permanent Superform, gaining:
- +15% all stats, except INT
- You lose the +15% stats, when using a Superform other than Namekian 'Bulked Form'.<br>

At level 12, a Namekian may use 'Unlock Potential' on two people who are not Namekians, plus an unlimited number of Namekians. This confers the benefits above. <br>

#### -=( Born of the Dragon )=-<br><br>

Some Nameks have a natural connection to the fundamental forces of the universe. These Nameks often become the leaders and Gurus of their people. They are natural healers, and more importantly can craft the sacred Dragon Balls.<br><br>
A Namek PC can be Born of the Dragon by taking the Chosen Unique or by submitting a background and getting the request approved by the staff.<br><br>
They gain the following:

- With a touch and by spending an Action, they allow someone else to receive their HP, Ki and END Regen for that Action. This includes any effects granted by Namekian Regeneration. If this power is used quickly (within a round) on someone recently dead, it can save them as though they had the Namekian's Sub LP. However, if the Namekian stops touching them even long enough to block, parry, or dodge or if they take any Action until the patient is completely healed, the patient dies. Out of combat, this healing applies the Namek's bonus recovery from regeneration to someone else.<br><br>
- You are capable of creating a set of Dragonballs. The exact process is different from game to game and at least as difficult as finding a set of existing dragonballs. Only one set of dragonballs may be created per planet and multiple Born of the Dragon Nameks may be in competition to achieve this. Talk to Staff; as it is an event unto itself.<br><br>

#### =( Permanently Splitting )=<br><br>

A Namekian may permanently split at any time, but only outside of combat. When this happens, the process creates two entirely new beings. If you begin from creation pre-Split, then they may have a completely different build; though if one build is clearly just a stat-donor build, don't expect it to be approved.<br><br>
The alignments of these two beings must be opposing. If one is Good, the other is Evil. If one is Neutral Good, the other is Neutral Evil. Neither Split may be True Neutral. Both characters HATE each other, as both represent the sum total of what the other abhors about themselves innately. They may not support each other directly or indirectly without staff approval. The idea of re-fusing is sickening and even in dire circumstances, feels wrong.<br><br>
Both Splits have 75% of the original Namek's Statistics. And both characters share experience, but you may only gain experience from one character at a time (i.e. you can't gain exp from one RPing while another is in a fight they get exp for).<br><br>
A player whose Namekian has Split like this, now has two characters to play. They can only play one of them at a time. If one dies, the other dies as well. So, it is both of their interest for both to stay alive, no matter how much they hate it. Likewise, if one is fused into a different Namek, both cease to exist (except with Re-Fusion).<br><br>
Normally, rejoining or Re-Fusing is something that neither wishes to do. Their opposing Split is a manifestation of all that they abhor and the other likely doesn't like him either. They may not re-fuse without staff approval. Neither can force the other. If it does happen, upon reforming into a single being, only one of the original Paths or True Neutral (pending GM approval) may be chosen. Restrictions on morality are also removed upon reforming. After re-fusing, they may not separate ever again.<br><br>

#### -=( Namekian Fusion )=-<br><br>

This is used only in dire circumstances; such as when a Namekian is dying or death is imminent and another Namekian is willing. This can never be forced upon a Namekian. And, Fusing must be approved by a GM.<br><br>
The Dominant Namekian will need to be chosen through Out-of-Character discussion. If this cannot be decided, roll dice. The Dominant Namekian adds 25% of the other Namekian's stats to their own as a Permenant Superform. Any items belonging to the Secondary Namekian now belong to the Dominant Namek. The Primary Namekian gains knowledge of hidden items from the Secondary Namekian. The fusion also grant the following:

- The Dominant Namekian gains the powers of the Secondary Namekians. And gain nothing if they already have them.
- Unless it's a Re-Fusion, the Dominant Namekian gains one of the Secondary Namekian's Personal Invents, which is adjusted for the new Namekian's Level.
- Any Powers with Prerequisite not met are gained, but cannot be used until the Requirements have been met.
- Any Regular School Invents are also gained. The new Namek may no longer learn these schools.
- Player Schools are not gained in this way, nor are their Invents or Powers.
- The new Namek's Alignment may be altered by the Fusion.

The Fusion can be done without GM supervision, but must have been approved beforehand. The Player should also inform a GM about the Fusion as soon as possible, including the time and room of where the Fusion took place. The Player should also keep the other Player's logs and stats at time of Fusion; to safeguard against being accused of cheating.

<h2 id="hr7">Paiku-han</h2>
Paiku-han are green-skinned humanoids with flat, square ears and large, light-colored lips. Paiku-han do not have hair or noses. Like humans, they love a challenge of any sort, either physical or mental. Originally from the planet Bayushi, life was rough on the underdeveloped planet. Failing to overcome a challenge usually meant death. They tend towards attempting to understand what already exists over attempting to create new things. As the former is safer on such a dangerous planet. This led to a relative lack of technological presence throughout the Neoverse, and explains why Paiku-han have a tendency to settle on remote, sparsely inhabited, or uncivilized planets. The attempts of Paiku-han to understand how the Universe works has led them to be a sort of intellectual-spiritual race, but not a religious one.<br><br>
The culture of the Bayushi-born reflects the values of most primitive tribal life. Though, they are by no means still primitive. Paiku-han are expected to provide for their family/group, protect the weak and less able, and respect the elders who are the leaders and teachers of the group. Strangers are usually treated with suspicion, but not overt hostility, until they have proven their worth or peaceful intentions. A Paiku, who has left their planet to seek fortune elsewhere, usually retains the same values. Greedy and selfish Paiku-han tend to die off from Bayushi's natural dangers. Though, multiple generations may eventually phase out those values.<br><br>
Average Height: 5'11" (180 cm)<br>
Average Weight: 190 pounds (86 kg)<br>
Life Span: 80-100 years.<br><br>
Interesting Traits: Paiku is the singular form of their race's name. Paiku-han is the plural. Paiku-han wear either turbans or tall, cylindrical hats with a turban-like wrap at the bottom.<br><br>

- (Ment) Paiku are granted Max (Hp+Ki)/50 damage to all attacks. (Charging does not affect this).<br><br>
- (Ment) Paiku have a natural affinity to Ki, gaining +2 to all Strikes. Any Ki, Sword, or H2H Invent made by them starts with 40 Invent points, instead of 30.<br><br>
- (Ment) Every Paiku has a unique Ki Attack Invent and follows normal Personal Ki Invent rules. It begins with 20 Invent points, which is not changed by the Paiku's racial feature or uniques. It is a special attack, which is usable once every two rounds.<br>

- (Phys) Paiku-han gain Max Base Ki/500 to all H2H and Sword Strikes. They also gain Max Base HP/500 to all Ki Strikes and (Max Base Ki+Max Base HP)/1000 to all Dodge rolls (Charging does not affect any of these). <br><br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Ment) 'Sonic Attack' - This power is automatically obtained at Level 1.<br> The Paiku can now use their voice to channel a devastating attack of Sonic Energy. It's a Ki attack that deals 1d4x10 damage, plus 1d4x10 damage per two levels. It's Unpreventable, Ignores Armor and Stuns the opponent (even through 'Advanced Block'). This attack can not be parried or countered. If a Paiku uses this power more than once, it has a 50% (50-1d100) chance of straining their voice so they're unable to use it for a Neo Week.<br><br>
- (Ment) 'Improved ESP' - The Paiku-han must have the Minor ESP power before taking this power.<br> You can now communicate across any distance with anyone that they have ever come in contact with as if they sensed the target. Improved ESP is two-way. If you communicate through ESP to someone, they can respond to you, even if they do not have this power or cannot sense you.<br><br>
- (Ment) 'True Versatility' - The Paiku must have the 'Sonic Attack' and 'Improved ESP' powers before taking this power.<br> The Paiku can now switch between fighting techniques more easily than others, making them more diverse in how they fight. They gain an additional use per round for one power of Level 3 or lower in each of the following power trees: Offensive Ki, Hand-to-Hand, and Sword.

<h2 id="hr8">Recoomian</h2>
Recoomians are tough, physically powerful warriors. They look somewhat like enormous, muscular humans of truly Herculean proportions, the shortest Recoomian still dwarfs most humans, and the weakest still look like humans on a strict steroid regimen. Most Recoomians have tall heads (and foreheads), tuft-like hair of varying shades of red, and large eyes with small irises.<br><br>
Recoomians value physical strength above all else, even from other races. If one were to call a Recoomian stupid, nothing out of the ordinary would happen, if they were instead called weak, a fight would immediately break out. The leader of a group of Recoomians is always the strongest, and any change of leadership is always through a one-on-one fight between challenger and current leader. This fight can occur at any time, even in the middle of a war if the leader agrees to it (they usually do). Those displaced from leadership in this way usually leave their group in shame and, if previously independent from servitude, go to Blue Star to serve an Icer.<br><br>
Recoomians who serve Icers are not viewed negatively by their brethren, as Icers are inherently strong and Recoomians have a long history of being subservient to them.<br><br>
Recoomians do not hold intelligence or mental acuity in very high regard. They believe such things are unnecessary to those who are strong enough. Such traits are not despised by Recoomians, however, they only hate those who use them as an excuse for their physical weakness. Most Recoomians are just smart enough to use basic technology of other races with some guidance, but have never invented anything useful.<br><br>
Average Height: 7' (213 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 250 pounds (113 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 50 years. Rare few, who do not die in combat or accidents, can live up to 110 years.<BR><BR>
Interesting Traits: Though slow and lumbering, Recoomians are graceful dancers.<BR><BR>
Example: Recoome (Rikuum).

- (Ment) Recoomians are granted Max Hp/25 damage to H2H and Sword attacks.<br><br>
- (Ment) Recoomians gain Max Base HP/750 to all Strikes and Dodges.<br><br>
- (Phys) Recoomians are very hard to tire. They have STMx2 Endurance and any powers that allow a Recoomian to regain Endurance gives them double the normal amount.<br><br>
- (Phys) Recoomians use STR/4 for their STR Mod instead of the regular STR/5 for H2H Damage and Parry Blast.<br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) 'Unrelenting Toughness' - This power can not be taken until level 3. <br> It grants the Recoomian a natural resistance of his STR/4. With the 'Resistance' Z power, this becomes STRx3/4.<br><br>
- (Ment) 'Adrenaline Boost' - This power can not be taken until level 5. <br> This power may only be activated when the Recoomian falls below 75% of their maximum HP. The first time its activated in a battle it may be done in response to receiving damage and does not take an action. Afterwards, it takes an action to de-activate it, re-activate it or change whether it is in "Offense" or "Defense" mode. While active, the Recoom gains +2 APR and they may select Offense or Defense. If they select Offense, they deal +50% Damage. If they select Defense, then they reduce all incoming damage by -50% or -25% if you block. However, all END costs are doubled, except for the END cost of Statboosters and the power 'Increase Powerlevel'. While active, the Recoomian may not use the powers 'Rest', 'Rejuvenate' or the Invent 'Meditation'. This counts as a Superform, but it stacks with Statboosters.<br><br>
  Off Template: ( Dice + STR Mod + Misc Mods ) x 1.5 + Bulk<br>
  Def Template: (Damage taken after shields, blocking and armor) x 0.50 - Resistance<br>
  Def Block Template: (Damage taken after blocking and armor)/2 x 0.75 - Resistance<br><br>
- (Ment) 'Recoom Boom!' - This power can not be taken until level 6 and requires the 'Adrenaline Boost' power. <br> This is a special Ki attack that is only usable in a Grapple and only when the Recoomian is considered the Attacker.<br>
  When this power is used, the Recoomian screams "RECOOM BOOM", replacing 'RECOOM' with their own name. They fire a burst of Ki from their mouth at the same time the Recoomian squeezes their victim in a vicious bear hug. It deals 1d6x10 damage per two levels of the Recoomian, plus all their bonuses to Ki attacks, plus their STR/2. The damage is Unpreventable and the Recoomian does not take damage from this attack unlike normal Ki attacks in a Grapple. It costs 15 Ki per 1d6x10 and can be used once every other round.<br>
  It can not gain bonuses from Powerful Ki User, any Bulking powers or anything that multiplies damage (Damaging aura, Berserker, Wild Ki, etc).

<h2 id="hr9">Reptilian</h2>
Reptilian Warriors are divided into several breeds; each of which have a different color and associated ability they focus in. While they were originally created artificially many hundreds of years ago, they've since developed into full-fledged, if very small, races of their own. They have no real home world to call their own, so they tend to be sparse in population density compared with any other race in the galaxy.<BR><BR>
Average Height: 5'6" - 12' (167-365 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 200-900 pounds (90-408 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 80 years.<BR><BR>
Interesting Traits: Tend to be reptilian in appearance with no ears and 'scaled' domed heads.<BR><BR>

- (Phys) Reptilians have an unusual clan-system. Depending on their Racial Class, provides you with access to their color-specific details.<BR><BR>

#### -=( Racial Classes )=-<BR><BR>

One of the most defining things about a reptilian is their breed or clan of origin. This is usually rather obvious, as reptilians are quite literally color-coded. The various types of Reptilians are so diverse, that they are practically unique races. The breeds of Reptilian are as follows:<BR>

#### Gold

The golden Reptilians were designed to be almost exclusively Ki users and very powerful ones at that. Their golden color can vary anywhere from being true, brilliant gold, to a darker, bronze sort of color.<BR>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) A true, pure design. Gold Reptilians start with +5 MNT.<br><br>
- (Ment) Gold reptilians have an excellent control of their Chi, so their Ki Modifier is 3 higher than normal<br><br>
- (Ment) Golden reptilians were created to harness ki much more effectively than other races, granting Max Ki/25 Damage to Ki Attacks (Charging does not affect this). Half of this bonus is applied to TK Attacks. <br><br>
- (Ment) Whenever you use a Telekinetic Power, your 'Psychic Aura', 'Solid Aura' and 'Ki Shield' each recover MNT/4 HP once per Action.<br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Ment) 'Evolved Spirit' - This power is automatically obtained at level 1.<br> Gold Reptilians use MNT/4 as their MNT Damage Mods.<br><br>
- (Ment) 'Golden Charge' - This power cannot be picked until level 5.<br> This power may be activated or deactivated as an Action. While active, the Golden Reptile may use a Telekinetic Power once per Action, without consuming that Action, so long as they didn't perform an Invent or a Combo. If this free Telekinetic Power is 'Telekinesis', 'Super Telekinesis', or 'Psionic Entemperment' it only costs 15 Ki per level. 'Telekinetic Enhancement' used in this feature is free, and (in the case of 'Super Telekinesis') making it SP costs no additional Ki. While active, you may not recover HP, END, or Ki in any way. If the unique 'Trance' is activated during this power's effects, you gain its bonus Ki and END when this power deactivates.<br><br>

#### Black

These are slightly more common than the other species of Reptilians, perhaps because they have a very simple existence: breaking things and breaking them well. Like rocks! Just how black they are varies from being the color of tar to only having dark skin.<BR>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<BR><BR>

- (Phys) A true, pure design. Black Reptilians start with +10 STR.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) A Black Reptile's muscle-reinforced scales are resistant to damage, allowing them to add their STR/4 to their Resistance.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) While in a Grapple, a Black Reptile's STR is considered 30% higher for purposes of Grapple checks, and their grapple-only moves deal +30% damage. Despite not actually being that big; Black Reptiles can grapple as Oozaru Sized opponents through their sheer strength.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) 'Omega Bulk Up' - This power can be taken anytime after 'Monstrous Form' is acquired.<BR> This power can only be used when in 'Monstrous Form' and is used to enhance a non-Combo H2H attack. The attack gains +5 to its Strike roll, the damage also becomes Armor Piercing and Shield Piercing. This power can only be used once per round and costs 8 Endurance. This Power is compatible with other forms of Bulks.

#### Blue

The blue breed of reptilian is unique amongst its brethren, having grown to focus on physical movement and combat mastery. As their name suggests, they are blue skinned, varying in intensity from sky blue to deep blue.<br><br>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) A true, pure design. Blue Reptilians start with +5 DEX and +5 SPD.<br><br>
- (Phys) The fastest being alive! Blue Reptilians gain +1 APR.<br><br>
- (Phys) You gain Max Base HP/500 to all H2H and Ki Strikes. You also gain Max Base Ki/500 to all Ki Strikes.<br><br>
- (Phys) Blue Reptilians gain +2 to all Strike and Dodge Rolls.<br><br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) 'Graceful Blue' - This power is automatically obtained at Level 1.<br> The Blue Reptilian may choose to use DEX/4 as their STR Mod for the purposes of calculating Strike, Dodge and Damage with Ki Attacks, Sword attacks and H2H attacks, they may also use DEX/4 as their MNT Mod when using Ki Attacks.<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Perfect Form' - This power cannot be taken until level 5.<br> The Blue Reptile's movements are graceful and flawless, like a dance of destruction. After using a Dodge power against an attack and if it succeeds, you may immediately make a counterattack as an H2H attack without consuming an action. This can only be used once per round and consumes 2 END.

#### Red

This caste of Reptilians is mainly true to their name in terms of color, though oranges and pinks are not unknown among them. They're unbelievably accurate.<BR><br>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<BR><br>

- (Phys) A true, pure design. Red Reptilians start with +5 DEX.<BR><BR>
- (Ment) Red Reptiles automatically start with the 'Multi-Punch' and 'Multi-Kick' powers. They may use both of those powers an additional time per round each.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) Red Reptiles are able to work off of pure reflexes. All penalties to strike, even those innate to the power or action being performed, are halved.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) Red Reptiles are quick to react, gaining DEX/30 to APR instead of the normal DEX/35; and +DEX/25 to Initiative.<BR><BR>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<BR><BR>

- (Phys) 'Evolved Coordination' - This power is automatically obtained at level 1.<BR> Red Reptiles are apt at working their limbs around the opponent's defenses, they use DEX/4 as their modifier on all H2H Strikes.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) 'Quick Fists' - This power cannot be picked until level 5.<BR> Activating or deactivating this Power takes an action. While active, the Red Reptile's H2H Damage Rolls gain +Levelx5 Damage and may use DEX/5 as their modifier for the Power 'Parry Blast'. Their H2H Attacks also become AP and SP. The Powers 'Multi-Kick' and 'Roundhouse Kick' may use DEX/4 as their damage modifier. Nothing that normally changes these modifiers may do so (such as Extremely Strong). While active, you may not recover HP, END, or Ki in any way. If the unique 'Trance' is activated during this power's effects, you gain its bonus Ki and END when this power deactivates.<BR><BR>

#### Green

Green Reptilians are noted for how difficult it is to subdue one by sheer force. While there are fewer exceptions to their color than with other breeds, they also have an extremely wide range of greens. <BR><br>

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) A true, pure design. Green Reptilians start with +10 STM.<BR><BR>
- (Phys) A green reptile is exceptionally resilient. Whenever they take more than 1/2 their Current HP in damage after reductions, they divide the damage by a further (1+STM/(200.0)).<br><br>
- (Phys) Green reptiles gain +1 to all Strike and Dodge rolls for every 650 Base Max HP they have.<br><br>
- (Phys) Green Reptiles are very hard to tire, they have STMx2 END.<br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) 'Evolved Toughness' - This power is automatically obtained at level 1.<br> Green reptiles are amazingly hard to wear down. They gain a +5 to their HP modifier.<br><br>
- (Phys) 'Ultra Boost' - This power cannot be picked until level 5.<br> This may be activated or deactivated as an action. While active, a Green Reptile's attacks cost an additional 2 END, but add HP x 10/100 to their damage rolls and Current END/100 to their Strike and Dodge rolls. This extra damage is added at most once per turn and is treated like a bonus from Bulk or PKU. Their attacks may not benefit from Bulk or PKU, except Bulking Aura, while this power is active. While active, you may not recover HP, END, or Ki in any way. If the unique 'Trance' is activated during this power's effects, you gain its bonus Ki and END when this power deactivates.

<h2 id="hr10">Saiyan Half-breed</h2>
Although there are many instances of interracial breeding, none are as frequently occurring as the human-saiyan pairing. Saiyans look down on these half-breeds and humans tend to fear them, making them outcasts no matter where they go. They share both a human's ingenuity and a saiyan's incredible lust for battle, as well as the ability to transform into gigantic fierce apes under the proper circumstances, making them interesting - and difficult - to fight. These Saiyans generally take on the normal Saiyan personality, with black spiky hair and a strong will for fighting. However, this is not always the case and some have been known to be born with oddities such as purple hair. Even stranger is the fact that these beings are capable of reaching the coveted status of Super Saiyan with ease, while their full blooded brethren must go through the most strenuous of ordeals.<BR><BR>
Average Height: 6' (182 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 210 pounds (95 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 60-80 years.<BR><BR>
Interesting Traits: Monkey-like tails, quick and intuitive, free access to Super Saiyan.<BR><BR>
Examples: Gohan, Trunks, Goten.

> Every Level-up, gain two powers.

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>

- (Phys) All Saiyan Half-Breeds have a tail which is a source of great power and great weakness for them. Their tail is required for both 'Oozaru Transformations'. When a Saiyan Half-Breed's tail is Grabbed (they look so Grabbable!) they become effectively paralyzed. The Saiyan Half-Breed can no longer take any Actions, Dodge, Parry or Counter and their STR is considered to now be 2, until their tail is released. Grabbing their tail is treated as a normal Grab attempt with an additional -5 penalty; Declaring that you're targeting their tail.<br><br>
- A Saiyan Half-Breeds's Tail has 5% of their Max HP. It can be regrown in a rejuvenator, regardless of the Saiyan Half-Breed's age in a Neo Week. Trying to strike their tail is at a -5 penalty and you can not use Multi=Attacks or Combos (They are too inaccurate to properly aim). You can not target a Saiyan Half-Breed's tail inside a Grapple with an attack.<br><br>
- (Ment) Saiyan Half-Breeds Regen Levelx3 Ki<br><br>
- (Phys) Although not actively bred for war; Saiyan Half-Breeds still inherit a portion of their ancestry. They gain Base HP/600 to all Strikes and Dodges.<br><br>
- (Ment) Saiyan-Martial Artist Aura: Inherited from a Martial Artist parent, this allows them to create a powerful defensive Aura from their Ki. It's a Reflexive Shield that costs ((Damage Stopped)x4)/3 Ki. There is no limit to the amount of Ki that can be spent. This may only be used once per Combo, but has no round limits. At level 3; it becomes Shield Piercing resistant. The Ki cost of this ability can never be reduced by more than 50% with suppression. Even at 90% suppression.<br><br>
- (Ment) The mixture of the wisdom of Martial Artists and the physical prowess of Saiyans have granted Saiyan Half-Breeds a heightened affinity with learning to control Ki. Their base invent points start at 40.<br><br>
- (Ment) Saiyan Half-Breeds gain additional Regular Schools at Levels 1, 5, 10 and 15. If they do not have the INT to learn another school then this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning future schools.<br><br>
- (Ment) Saiyan Half-Breeds have a 10% chance per level of controlling Oozaru with a Max of 80%.<br><br>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>

- (Ment) 'False Moon' - This power can not be taken until level 3.<br>
  This power allows the Saiyan Half-Breed to create a pale, shining orb in the air which mimics a moon. It allows a Saiyan Half-Breed to stare into its bright light and transform into their Oozaru form, even if the Planet they are on has no moon or if it's daytime. This costs 25% of your current END and Ki (including Charging Ki Pools). The transformation lasts until there are no opponents left (note that a rampaging Oozaru considers all non-Oozaru its enemy) or until the Saiyan's tail is cut off. Every Saiyan and Half-Saiyan in the combat who is capable of transforming into Oozaru does so, paying this power's cost even if they do not know it. This is a superform with the following traits:
- +50% STR
- +100% STM for purposes of calculating Hitpoints only.
- Can uproot a piece of the scenery (usually a tree) as a non-action to use as an improvised sword that has -2 Strike but deals 1d6x10 damage per level. Plot relevant scenery and scenery with mechanically important traits may not be used in this fashion.
- Can Bite as a basic Melee attack, even in a grapple. This deals your STR/4+STR Mod + Misc Modifiers AP/SP Damage. Inside of a grapple the attack gains UP but may not benefit from Bulk.
- You may use the Mouthblast power even if you do not normally know it, and it deals 1d6x10 AP damage per level instead of normal.
- Oozaru can hold up to two people, one in each hand. When grappling in this way, each person can break out against half of the Oozaru's STR to get free. If one escapes and the Oozaru has an action between the Escapee and the remaining Defender, the second person must deal with the Oozaru's full strength as normal. With the Goon unique, this is raised to 3/4 STR for two Defenders.
- An Oozaru may never be the defender in a grapple except if the attacker is similarly sized. This means another Oozaru, the Wyrm Dragon, or some NPCs.
- The Oozaru may not use superspeeds when maintaining two Defenders in a grapple or benefit from move-speed dependent bonuses.
- While the Oozaru grapples a single opponent, he may make strikes against people outside of the grapple as well as parry, dodge or block. You may also use superspeeds for attacks or defenses originating outside of the grapple.
- This Superform -stacks- additively with Super Saiyan, Ultimate Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, and Super Saiyan 3 but the bonuses to all stats except INT are reduced by 10%.
- When you attack or attempt to end combat while anyone else is nearby, roll (Your Control Chance)-1d100. On a result of 0 or higher, nothing happens. On a result of 1 or higher, randomize the target of the attack. You may attack allies in this fashion, although friendly Oozaru may be exempt at that attacker's wish. If you were trying to end combat, then you must use an attack instead, which may not be a basic attack, Jumpkick or Eyebeams unless only basic attacks are available.

Note: At the GM's discression, it can be a full moon out, causing all Saiyans to transform automatically as a pre-round action. They still need to pay the associated Ki and END cost.
Example: A SSJ2 Half-Saiyan that goes into Oozaru form would gain +70% STR, +20% all other stats and +2 to their HP/Ki modifier. They would use +120% STM for purposes of determining their hitpoints only.

- (Phys) 'Tail Training' - This power can not be taken until level 5.<br>
  It allows the Saiyan to use their Tail in combat. Their tail is considered a basic Hand to Hand attack which has a +1 to Strike and inflicts 4d6 per level. Someone grabbing your tail no longer paralyzes you or reduces your STR and your Tail now has 10% of your Maximum HP in place of its original HP.

- (Ment) 'Super Saiyan' - This power can not be taken until level 6.<br>
  Saiyan Half-Breeds have the uncanny ability to transform into something their full-blooded brethren struggle with. Maybe its the humanity that is added to the warrior spirit, but whatever it is it's a potent combination. In this form, a Saiyan's hair turns golden and stands up a bit and their pupils become green. Their aura turns a bright, flaring gold and you gain the following bonuses:
- +15% all stats (except INT)
- +1 HP Mod
- +1 Ki Mod
- This costs 10% of your maximum base (no superforms!) END.

- (Ment) 'Ultimate Super Saiyan' - This power can not be taken until level 7, and requires Super Saiyan.<br>
  The Ultimate Super Saiyan or the 'Ascended Saiyan'. This form is similar to Super Saiyan, but more physically powerful and unbalancing, sacrificing their ability to move. In this form, a Saiyan's hair will become a bit more spiky and he becomes more muscular. You gain the following bonuses:
- +25% STR
- +15% MNT and STM
- +10% DEX and SPD
- Use STR/4 as your STR Modifier for H2H Damage and Parry Blast
- This costs 10% of your maximum base (no superforms!) END.

- (Ment) 'Super Saiyan 2' - This power can not be taken until level 11, and requires Ultimate Super Saiyan.<br>
  This form is a perfected version of USSJ. The Saiyan's hair stands straight up and grows a bit longer. Unlike USSJ, however - they retain their speed and maneuverability and get maybe even stronger. This transformation may only be activated while Super Saiyan or Ultimate Super Saiyan is active.
- +25% All Stats (except INT)
- +2 HP Mod
- +2 Ki Mod
- This costs 20% of your maximum base (no superforms!) END.

- (Ment) 'SSJ Training' - This power can not be taken until level 12, and requires Super Saiyan 2.<br>
  You have perfected your mastery over your transformations. This grants you the following benefits:
- Super Saiyan may be activated pre-round and costs no Endurance to transform into. This does not affect advanced forms of Super Saiyan.
- As an action taken while in Ultimate Super Saiyan, you may alter the form's bonuses--setting their SPD/DEX modifier between +10% and -100%. For every 1% of SPD and DEX you sacrifice you gain +2% STR. You may take this action even if you are in a Capture ball, stunned, or otherwise incapacitated You may not do this while Oozaru is active or while Grappling.

<h2 id="hr11">Zargonian</h2>
Zargonians typically look like attractive humans with one or two major differences. This alien race finds its ancestry shared with a race of reptiles, and have yet been able to purge themselves of all reptile DNA. Because of this, they still share some traits of their reptilian ancestry. Zargonian skin typically comes in varying shades of green. The lighter the green, the more desirable the Zargonian. Conversely, their hair comes in shades of green as well - however if the hair and skin do not contrast, the Zargonian is considered ugly and undesirable by his or her people. Their eyes come in various shades of yellow and orange, with rare cases being spotted of green or hazel. Any Zargonian worth his weight in gold will go to great lengths to always look his or her best.<br><br>
Beauty is only skin deep, however. Each and every member of the Zargonian populace is capable of transforming into a hideously ugly monster, perhaps a physical embodiment of their own vanity. Most loathe to show this monster. Once a Zargonian has gone through the great lengths to transform and show you his or her inner self, they'll most likely want to make sure you never tell anyone what you've seen.<br><br>
Some say that the Zargonians came into the service of the Icers hoping to learn how to perfect their transformation skills. But few actually believe that the Zargonians weren't conquered by the more war like race and forced into slavery.<br><br>
Average Height: 5'8" - 6'4" (172-193 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 150-250 pounds (68-113 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 120-140 years.<BR><BR>
Interesting Traits: Occasionally Zargonians are born with scales on various parts of their bodies. Most Zargonians opt to have these scales removed. This is very rare, however and is not a desired trait among the race. Also, Zargonians love mirrors, and will often carry one on hand.<BR><BR>
Example: Zarbon.

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<BR><BR>

- (Ment) Zargonians are granted Max Hp/25 damage to Hand-to-Hand and Sword attacks (Charging does not affect this).<BR><BR>
- (Ment) Zargonians gain Base Max HP/600 to all Strikes and Dodges.<BR><BR>
- (Ment) Zargonians recover faster than most others and Regen levelx3 Ki and HP.<BR><BR>
- (Ment) Zargonians are usually found to be arrogant or confident of their power and abilities, often having to prove their skill when fighting outnumbered - because of this they are left to let the beast rampage against any that oppose them. When you're outnumbered in a Team Battle, the Zargonian receives +1 Strike (applies to Parry), Dodge and Initiative and +5xLevel to all Damage (not TK) per additional opponent beyond the first, to a limit of 4.<BR><BR>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<BR><BR>

- (Phys) 'Monstrous Form' - This power is automatically obtained at level 1.<br> This transformation is used by Zargonians when losing a serious fight typically. As almost all Zargonians despise the way they look while they're in it. This transformation can't be used until they are knocked below 75% of their Maximum HP, though they can transform instantly reflexively, or wait until later by using an Action. The Zargonian will then remain in this form until the end of combat, even if their regeneration takes them back above 75% HP. While in this form, it grants:
- -10% MNT
- +50% STR
- +10% DEX
- +10% STM
- +10% SPD
- +Levelx3 resistance
- Does not suffer from Form XP penalties.

- (Phys) 'Omega Bulk Up' - This power can be taken anytime after 'Monstrous Form' is acquired.<BR> This power can only be used when in 'Monstrous Form' and is used to enhance a non-Combo H2H attack. The attack gains +5 to its Strike roll, the damage also becomes Armor Piercing and Shield Piercing. This power can only be used once per round and costs 8 Endurance. This Power is compatible with other forms of Bulks.
