There are slight differences in each category. They each gain their own positives and negatives. Outside of these pros and cons, your racial category will determine their EXP chart.

-=( Low Races )=-
Low Races gain additions to their HP and Ki mods as they level up. They learn schools as they level up, and tend to know more schools than other racial categories. However, their stats and Hp/Ki modifiers start out low. Meaning, it can take time for these races to reach their prime.

-=( Medium Races )=-
Like Low Races, Medium Races gain additions to their Hp/Ki Mods as they level up. They, also, gain small periodic bonuses to all of their stats as they level. They start off with average stats, and tend to be more specialized than other races in what they do.

-=( High Races )=-
These races tend to have high starting stats, good Hp/Ki modifiers, and superforms. Those that don't have superforms tend to have abilities, which sometimes act like them instead. Due to their starting and progressive power, High Races tend to level slower.

-=( Restricted Races )=-
These races are unique in that only one of each restricted may exist at any given time. There are special rules for obtaining one, as described in their section. These tend to be extremely powerful and extremely rare creatures with abilities that either far exceed those of other races. To compensate for this, they level extremely slowly. They, too, get a bonus to powers, though not as frequently as High Races.

-=( Superforms )=-
A superform is any racial feature or power that increases the ability of a character through a transformation. Transformations cannot be done pre-round unless stated otherwise (like Icer Form 2) and must be done during battle, taking actions to do so. Some superforms, such as Super Saiyans or Namekian Bulked Form, allow for races to immediately gain their forms when they take an action to do so. However, others may be limited by a HP% or similar restrictions, like Makyosei-jin's Improved Growth Form requiring the Makyosei-jin to transform into their Growth Form before going into their Improved Growth Form.

A superform modifies a character's -base- statistics, which are the statistics they have before counting any items such as trinkets or any other superforms. Superforms do not stack with each other or with Statboosters. You recalculate your character's derived traits (HP, Ki, End, APR, etc) based on the bonuses achieved through the superform.

Gained APR is added to the end of the current round. Your current HP, Ki, Natural Shields, Natural Armor, and END raise by the same amount as your maximum, but only rise the first time you activate a particular superform or statbooster. When your derived traits are lowered through a superform or if you leave a superform, the opposite happens. Your current HP, Ki, End, Natural Shields, and Natural Armor's current and maximum values are lowered. APR is taken from the end of the Round, if any APR is left.
