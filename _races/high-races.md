<h2 id="hr1">Androids</h2>
Androids are sentient machines, constructed either from scratch or by heavily modifying an existing organism. In either case the result is a robotic warrior with amazing power capable of far more than a normal human. For hundreds of years, the Neoverse has been thriving to create artifical intelligence for good, evil and everything inbetween. It took many, many years but a group of scientists finally made a breakthrough: A fully sentient machine. It was capable of amazing feats that no human could possibly do without intense training - travel in space being the most prominent. Fortunately for the Neoverse, these scientists rarly shared how the managed to do it, because the Androids rebelled - unable to be controlled by petty humans. It was because of this that the creators decided to stop making them. But, from time to time someone comes across the blueprints and re-creates an android, adding personal touches to them be it impressive shielding capabilities or extreme firepower. Regardless of how, when or why they were created, they are potent warriors with amazing power.<br><br>
Average Height: Varies drastically based on creator's preferences.<br>
Average Weight: Several tons.<br>
Life Span: Theoretically, androids are ageless. But, few models continue working after a thousand years.<br>
Interesting Traits: Man-made machines, limitless options, mostly human-based (humans being generally the only ones with the technology to create them) but there are exceptions.<br><br>
Example: Androids 16 through 20.

   | Stat | Base  |
|:---:|:------------|
|  Int  |    21     |
|  Mnt  |    21     |
|  Str |     21    |
|  Dex  |   21     |
|  Stm  |   N/A |
  |  Spd  | 21    |

> Distribute 50 additional points, max of 17 in 1 stat.<BR><BR>
HP: 14 x STR + 25 x Level<BR>
KI: 14 x MNT + 25 x Level<BR>
LP: 17 x STR<BR><BR>
Every Level-up, Androids gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br><br>
At Level 1, pick six powers. <br>
Every Level-up, gain two powers.<br>
Every even Level (2, 4, 6, etc), gain one additional Power.

<BR>
#### -=( Racial Features )=-<BR><BR>
(Ment) Androids can not take Powers from the Ki Awareness or Powering Up trees. If they would gain a Ki Awareness Power, they instead gain an Offensive Ki Power. A Powering Up Power instead gives them a Defense Ki Power. The Powers Rest and Rejuvenation do not exist for Androids and bypass them as requirements. Androids can never learn TK Powers and sources that give them are simply lost. Androids may not choose the Uniques Enhanced Awareness or Psionicist.<BR><BR>
(Phys) Since Androids are machines, they can not be detected by any form of Ki Sense. Scouters give a location and direction, but Androids lack a Powerlevel. Androids themselves have a built-in Scouter, with a success chance of (60+Int)%, which allows them to communicate across any distance for free with any Scouter or dwelling with the Communicator Upgrade. Powerlevels; aside from the number, are indistinguishable from one another. They also have an internal generator that grants them Level x 10 Ki Regen and have no Ki Charging Pools. <BR><BR>
(Phys) Androids have no STM Stat and no END. Costs of 1 END are ignored, but everything else (including END lost from things like Bruiser or being parried) causes them to lose 15 Ki per point of END. If a Ki Cost is multiplied; it is calculated before the additional 'End' cost is added as Ki. If they ever reach 0 Ki; they pass out as if they'd run out of END. <BR><BR>
(Phys) Whenever an Android's STM Stat would go up from a School that gives no bonus to STR, they instead add the STM increase to their STR score. Bonuses from Uniques work the same way. In any other situation, unless otherwise stated, all gains from STM are simply lost. <BR><BR>
(Phys) Androids can survive in normally-intolerable environments (such as Space, or Underwater), as they are machines. They do not need to breathe or sleep, and are immune to the Power 'Choke'. <BR><BR>
(Ment) An Android's artificial intelligence allows them to memorize and analyze things far better than a living person can, though they're often somewhat uncreative. All of their invents have a base of 35 points, instead of 30. <BR><BR>
(Phys) Androids, being the pure essence of technology, have the ability to upgrade themselves over time to improve their performance. An Android may select a new Racial Upgrade on every odd level. (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc). See Racial Upgrades later. <BR><BR>
(Phys) Androids have a harder time improving themselves during Combat than living beings. Statbooster Invents for Androids start out granting 1 stat point per 9 invent points (instead of 7). <BR><BR>


(Ment) When Charging a Ki Attack; Androids put double the Ki they would naturally Regen into the Attack, but do not Regen Ki while Charging an Attack. They do not have the normal Level x 3 limit to how many times they can charge into an Attack per Battle.<BR><BR>
(Phys) Androids are built to be as efficient as possible in their movements. They gain Base Max HP/700 to all Strikes and Dodges.<BR><BR>

#### -=( Android Models )=-
On Creation, you choose one of the listed models which functions like a racial class.<BR>

#### No Model
A basic Android with no specialized functions. Their lack of specialization gives room to more generalized improvements and allows them to be a little more resilient. You gain the following:<BR>
* +4 All Stats (except STM)
* +1 HP and Ki Modifier.
* Additional +1 to their HP *or* Ki Modifier, chosen on Creation.
* Gain additional Racial Upgrades at Levels 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
#### Completed Programming
As an Action; you may gain the 'NM' marked benefits of any of the other Android Model Types (before their Completed Programming) until you use this Feature again. You do not gain Stats, HP mods, Ki mods or bonus Powers. You additionally may take an Action during Pre-Round phase, so long as it doesn't effect anyone else.

#### Barrier Model
This type has a unique shield generator, which allows them to create extremely potent barriers of energy. You gain the following:
* +3 All Stats (except STM)
* +1 HP and Ki Modifier.
* (NM) You may spend up to 25 Ki per Level on a Reflexive Racial Shield. You stop 4 Damage (or 2 Damage SP) per Ki spent. You may use it an unlimited number of times per round. Against Combos; it still only works against one Attack.
#### Completed Programming
Your shield may now stop UP Damage at the rate of 1 Damage per 1 Ki spent per Level. Additionally, you may now use each version of this Shield (Normal, SP-Resistant, UP-Resistant) against each part of a Combo. Further, once per Defense this Shield may become Flaring, returning 20% (or 10% against Ki Attacks) of the Damage it stops as UP/AS Damage. In the case of Sword Multis; this Flaring only applies to one Damage roll.

#### Energy Absorption Model
These models have special crystals in the palms of their hands which can absorb energy they come in contact with. You gain the following:
* +5 STR, +2 all other stats (except STM)
* +2 HP Mod and -1 Ki Mod.
* You gain the 'Parry Blast' Power.
* (NM) You have a seperate Ki Pool called 'Drain Ki' where all of your drained Ki goes, similar to a Charging Ki Pool that does not Regen. Ki may be spent from this pool freely.
* (NM) While you're the Attacker in a Grapple, you may Drain a victim as an Action. This steals an Opponents Levelx1 in END and Levelx10 Ki. The Android gains the drained Ki to its 'Drain Pool'.
* (NM) When you use 'Parry Blast', you do not suffer the normal -5 penalty to the Strike roll. Other strike penalties, such as against Multi-attacks, apply normally. On a successful Parry Blast result, you gain all Ki spent on the Attack plus Addons. Alternatively, you may recover 1 HP for every 2 Ki you would have absorbed in this way.
#### Completed Programming
Whenever you drain someone's Ki in a Grapple, you get a cumulative +5% STR for purposes of Grapple Checks until the current Grapple ends. When someone uses 'Flare' to Break out of a Grapple with you; you gain 10% of their Maximum Ki added to your Drained Ki pool. Finally, you may reflexively spend 500 Ki to lower your STR Mod divisor for the duration of one Action or one Parry Blast (STR/5 becomes STR/4. STR/4 becomes STR/3).

#### Hell's Flash Model
These Androids can remove their hands at the wrists, to reveal powerful energy cannons built into their arms. You gain the following:
* +5 MNT, +2 all other stats (except STM)
* +2 Ki Mod and -1 HP Mod.
* (NM) Removing or Re-attaching your hands may be done as an Action or as part of the Pre-round.
* (NM) While your arms are attached; you may launch them as part of a H2H Attack that explicitly states it uses fists. This allows you to use your Ki Strike in place of your H2H Strike, your MNT Mod in place of your STR Mod and both your H2H Misc Mods and Ki Misc Mods for Damage. This Attack may benefit from Bulk or PKU, but not both. This attack may be a Grab attempt, reeling in the Target; but your arms will be Unattached afterwards.
* (NM) While your arms are not attached, your Ki Attacks are enhanced. Gaining +4 Ki Strike and +100% Damage, but costing 100% more base Ki (not Addons). Eyebeams and Mouthblast cannot benefit from this. While your hands are unattached, you may not use H2H or Sword Attacks (including the Ki Attack from Ki Enhance), but you may maintain a Grab as if a cable is wrapped around the target.

#### Completed Programming
You may attach or unattach your hands at will without spending an Action to do so and even do it Immediately; such as during an Action like a Combo. You may always perform H2H Attacks, as if you'd launched your fists and Immediately recovered them. Finally, the Base Ki Cost is only increased by 50%.<br><br>
Template: (Dice + Mnt Mod + Misc mods ) x2 + PKU<br>
Multi Template: ((Dice ) x (Mnt Mod) + Misc mods ) x 1.5 + PKU<br>
Ki Cost: (Base Cost ) x2 + PKU

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<BR><BR>
(Phys) 'Zero Shift' - You cannot take this power until you've reached level 3.<BR> This Power modifies an Android's existing propulsion system, allowing them to create a controlled, temporary overload which results in a short burst of amazing speed and maneuverability. When used, this grants the Android +5 to their Strike or Dodge Rolls for an Action. This even applies against TK Attacks and stacks other valid Superspeeds. 'Zero Shift' costs 5% of your Maximum Ki to use; +5% of your Maximum Ki per previous use during the same Round.<BR><BR>
(Ment) 'Advanced Targeting Computer' - This power can not be taken until level 5.<BR> You may use your Scouter to Lock-on to a Target as a Pre-round Action. This gives you a cumulative +2 bonus on all Strike and Dodge Rolls on that Target for the rest of Combat, to a maximum of +Level/2.
(Ment) 'Completed Programming' - This power can not be taken until level 6.<BR> When it's taken, the Android reaches the pinnacle of their performance; refining themselves to truly staggering levels. The exact nature of what this power gives depends on the Android's Model and is shown in each Models' section.
(Phys) 'Generator Enhancement' - This power can not be taken until level 7.<BR> When taken, this Power increases an android's in-Battle Ki Regen by Levelx5.
(Phys) 'Defense Matrix' - This power can not be taken until level 8.<BR> Once per Battle, the Android can project an exceptionally powerful forcefield; which can protect against virtually any Attack. As it's not an actual shield, this power works normally against SP, UP and US attacks. However, it can not be used in conjunction with any type of Blocking, Auras or Shielding and Resistance does not apply when using it. This Power divides the damage taken from an attack by 8 and functions against all Attacks in a Combo situation, combined. Against attacks which do not deal Damage, Defense Matrix stops them entirely as if it used Freeze. It Costs 300 Ki to use and can not be used in a grapple and it is not reflexive.<BR>
Template: (Damage taken - Armor)/8<BR><BR>

#### -=( Android Upgrades )=-
1) Afterburners<BR>
An Android's propulsion system is modified by adding a new cooling system or some good old engines strapped onto their back. This lets the Android add the higher of their MNT or STR to their SPD, for purposes of determining how fast they move in MPH or LYPH. This doubles the Ki Cost of the Power used. If they're concerned about efficiency; the Android can choose not to use this Upgrade.<BR><BR>
2) Discern Power<BR>
With this Upgrade, a few modifications are made to their Scouter and how the Android picks up Powerlevels; allowing them to memorize a person's aura. There is no limit to how many people they can now remember. You do not recognize any auras that you sensed before you had this Upgrade, until you sense them with it.<BR><BR>
3) Enhanced Espionage Unit<BR>
With this Upgrade, an Android can fine-tune its generator to give off a special, detectable Ki signiture like the ones given off by actual people. You're able to utilize the 'Current Powerlevel' displayed on your sheet (Failing this, use ((Current HP + Current Ki) x ( STR + DEX + SPD )) / 12 ). While unconcious, you have a static Powerlvel equal to 1% of your normal value; representing your generator running 'idle'. This can be turned on or off at-will. In Combat, this can allow an Opponent to use Sense Ki's Ki-Lock on you.<BR><BR>
4) Nano-Repair Systems<BR>
With this Upgrade, an Android gains a colony of microscopic robots inside and on them which can repair damaged circuits, machinery and damage all over their body. If an Android suffers a Critical Hit and receives penalties from it (basically, if a limb is broken or worse) the nano machines can repair it quickly outside of Battle.<BR><BR>
When out of Battle, the Android can heal any broken, shattered, or lost body part within three Real-Life Hours. Since all their energy is going in to these repairs, they won't be able to Regen Ki until the process is over. If an Android was KO'd from its Ki getting to 0; it must Regen to at least 1 Ki before Nano-Repair Systems take over. If the limb has been cut off; the Android needs to find the lost limb in order to reattach it. They can create a completely new one, but this takes an entire Neo week in place of the three real life hours.<BR><BR>
5) Nanowave Telepathy<BR>
With this Upgrade an Android can send out special transmissions that will play a message in the database of another Android or Scouter that it has Scouted (previously or otherwise). This creates a special two-way frequency of communication, which doesn't require a hidden Android to reveal its location. People with a scouter that has the communicator addon may also be targeted and respond.<BR><BR>
6) Scouter Cloaking<BR>
With this Upgrade, an Android has various small modifications made to itself which conceal the energy it gives off just from functioning, creating a means to mask the emissions specific kinds of Scouters look for. Each Level of this Upgrade blocks only a specific kind of Scouter; so taking Rank 4 would stop the Android from being detected by Rank 4 Scouters, but not the others. This Upgrade only needs to be taken once, as it Upgrades itself over time.<BR><BR>
For every two Levels total you have, you may select a Scouter level that the Upgrade protects against and may be taken out of order. Once you reached level 12, you would have all of them, making you undetectable to all buyable Scouters and give -180% against other Androids and Ghetti detection attempts. <br>
 * 1 - Rank 1 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
 * 2 - Rank 2 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
 * 3 - Rank 3 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
 * 4 - Rank 4 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
 * 5 - Rank 5 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
 * 6 - Rank 6 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
 
7) Solar Fiber<br>
When this Upgrade is taken, the Android replaces its hair or other exposed skin with special fibers that gather solar and other energy from the surrounding area to help alleviate some of the stress on the Android's generator. Because of this, the Android is able to recharge and repair themselves much quicker; HP, LP and Ki Regen is double the normal rate Out of Combat. This also halves the time it takes for Nano-Repair Systems to repair Critical Effects, if they have it.<br><br>
8) Scouter Jamming<br>
Requires four levels or more of the Scouter Cloaking Upgrade.<br>
This Upgrade transmits a special frequency that can scramble any Scouter or scanning device within a mile of the Android producing it. Any scouter or Scanning Device in this area will not function and nothing inside the radius can be Scouted or Scanned. This Upgrade can be turned on and off at will and effects even the Android's own Scouter when on.<br><br>
9) Scouter Upgrades<br>
An Android's built-in Scouters are far from perfect, but on the other hand that means there's plenty of room for improvement. This Upgrade improve the accuracy of the Android's scanning ability, to the point where they can actually assess various parameters of a fighter's abilities. This Upgrade only needs to be taken once, as it Upgrades itself over time; gaining one Rank for every two total Levels the Android has.<br><br>
Each Rank of this Upgrade, your Scouter gains +20% success rate. For each Rank, you may select one STAT other than INT. You can Scan a target within sight distance; functioning as a 'Sense' roll, you can learn their exact STAT values that you can scan for. In combat; this costs an Action.<br><br>
10) Accelerated Nano-Repair<br>
This Upgrade requires the Android to have 'Nano-Repair Systems' before it can be taken.<br>
Through the use of this Upgrade, an Android can drastically accelerate the speed at which their Nano-Repair Systems work, but not done very efficiently. This gives them Regen of Levelx5 HP at the cost of reducing their Ki Regen by Levelx5. This Upgrade can be turned on or off Pre-round or by spending an Action to do so.<br><br>
11) Suppression Coils<br>
While most Androids strive to improve themselves, some merely wish to be more like those around them. This Upgrade provides Androids with the ability to scale their performance down, if necessary and saves them energy as a nice bonus. This functions similarly to the 'Suppress powerlevel' Power; the Android reduces their Strike and Dodge by -1, their Damage by 10% and reducing their Ki Costs on everything by 5%, per penalty to a maximum of -1 per two Levels. When paired with the 'Enhanced Espionage Unit' Upgrade, this causes your 'Powerlevel' to also drop by 10% for each -1 penalty. The maximum penalty you may impose upon yourself is -10.<br><br>
12) Tactical Analysis Programming<br>
This Upgrade requires the Android to have Rank 3 or higher 'Scouter Upgrade' before it can be taken.<br>
Once per Round, you can spend an Action to Scan your opponent; revealing their current HP, Ki or END. This Upgrade can be taken up to three times; each time it's taken, it lets you learn another aspect of the Upgrade. When you have multiple Upgrades, you discern all of the selected attributes together.<br><br>
13) Multi-Lock Systems<br>
This Upgrade requires the Android to have 'Advanced Targeting Computer' before it can be taken.<br>
When you use your 'Advanced Targeting Computer' to lock on in a fight, you may lock-on to as many combatants as you choose.<br><br>
14) Hard Light Weaponry<br>
This upgrade allows the Android to produce super-high-tech laser weaponry; now able to acquire the 'Ki Shaping' or 'Psionic Entemperment' Powers; ignoring their usual limitations on Androids against taking these Powers. It costs only 5 Ki per Level each swing to use, and the Android gains +5 x Level Misc Mod Damage when attacking.



<h2 id="hr2">Bojakchan</h2>

Having wandered the Neoverse for thousands of years, or so is the story, the mighty Bojackans have nowhere to call home. Legend has it their homeworld was destroyed in the War against Hell, others say that they never had a homeworld - they are and always have been the Pirates of the Neoverse. Regardless, they are a force to be reckoned with, as they work amazingly well in teams, taking awesome advantage of the distraction that their teammates provide. Not only are they great in teams, but they have some other interesting abilities that can increase their potential in battle.<br><br>
Average Height: 6'4" (193 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 300 pounds (136 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 100-150 years.<BR><br>
Interesting Traits: Blue skin, brightly coloured hair, pointy ears, most are space pirates.<br><br>
Example: Bojack, Bido, Bujin, Kogu, Zangya.
  
  | Stat | Base  |
|:---:|:------------|
|  Int  |    20     |
|  Mnt  |    25     |
|  Str |     25    |
|  Dex  |    25    |
|  Stm  |  25  |
  |  Spd  |  25  |

> Distribute 58 additional points, max of 20 in 1 stat.<BR><BR>
HP: 14 x STM + 25 x Level<BR>
KI: 14 x MNT + 25 x Level<BR>
LP: 18 x STM<BR><BR>
Every Level-up, Bojackans gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br>
Every Level-up, gain two powers.<br>
Every even Level (2, 4, 6, etc), gain one additional Power.

<BR>
#### -=( Racial Features )=-<BR><BR>

(Ment) Bojackans are granted Base Max Ki/25 damage to all damage types (Charging does not affect this).<BR><BR>
(Ment) Bojackans are skilled combatants and know how to take advantage of an enemies hesitation. If they are the first to act in a Round, they receive +5 to all Strikes and Dodges for the rest of that Round. In Team Fight situations; as long as a Bojackan beats all other Opponents Initiative Rolls, they gain this bonus.<BR><BR>
(Ment) Bojackans are best suited to work in groups with other warriors. If fighting with a team, they gain +2 to all Strikes and Dodges if they have an Ally on their side. And gain +2 to Strikes and Dodges if they are facing two or more opponents. Defeated characters, characters not currently actively participating in the Battle, and Splitform Powers do not count towards this.<BR><BR>
(Ment) Bojackans are reckless fighters by nature, using sudden and unorthodox attacks to catch their opponents off guard. After seeing the initiative rolls, the Bojackan may choose to increase their Initiative total by lowering their Strike and Dodge for the round by -1 per +3 bonus to Initiative, to a maximum of -5 Strike and Dodge and +15 Initiative. If multiple Bojacks are present, they make this choice in order of lowest initially rolled initiative to highest.<BR><BR>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<BR><BR>

(Ment) 'Energy Strands' - This power can not be taken until level 3.<BR>
Once per Round, Bojackans can fire thin strands of pure energy to entangle and hold an opponent. This costs 5% of the Bojackan's Maximum Ki and counts as a Ki Attack or H2H Attack (their choice) with a -4 penalty to Strike that cannot be parried. If the Bojackan hits, then the target is Grappled by the strands. The target and the strands themselves are considered Grappled together and unable to defend themselves, but the Bojackan is not. The strands have Levelx100 HP, Levelx5 Damage Resistance, are immune to H2H Attacks without SP Charge and use the Bojackan's MNT/2 instead of STR/2 for all Grapple checks. The Strands dissipate if they somehow become the Defender in the grapple. The Bojackan may not use Energy Strands against those already involved in a normal melee Grapple, nor may someone who is caught in the Strands be grappled normally (the strands hurt!). While holding someone, the Bojackan may only take the following actions:
 * Crush: MNT/2 UP/AP Damage and the victim loses 5 ki per Level of the Bojackan. 
 * Strand Throw: MNT/2 + MNT Mod + Misc Ki Mods UP Damage and Stuns the Target (even if they take no Damage). Ends the Grapple.
 * Strand Slam: (MNT + MNT Mod ) + Misc Mods UP Damage. Ends the Grapple.

Bojackans may work together when using Energy Strands. If one Bojackan has someone Grappled with their Energy Strands, any other Bojackans in Combat may choose to use their own Energy Strands against that target, which automatically hits. Each additional Bojackan who adds their Strands causes the original users' MNT to be considered +25% higher any time the Victim attempts to Break free and add their own Strands' HP to the ones Grappling the victim. Only the original user of Strands can make Attacks against the victim, but on each of the additional Bojackan's Actions that this is maintained, the victim loses an additional 5 Ki per Level of that Bojackan. The Bojackans do not gain this Ki; it is simply lost.




(Phys) 'Superform' - This Power can not be taken until level 5.<br> It allows the Bojack to transform into a stronger state, which grants the the following bonuses:
  * +20% Mnt
  * +20% Str
  * +20% Dex
  * +20% Stm
  * +20% Spd
  * This costs 10% of your Base END.
  * At Level 7; their Superform gets more powerful, granting +2 to their HP and Ki Mods. 
  * At Level 11 it increases again; no longer costing any END to activate and it can then be activated as a Pre-Round Action.


#### -=( Racial Class )=-<BR><BR>

All Bojackans have a Racial class which determines some of their starting abilities. Any Racial class may be picked at creation except for Legendary Bojackan, if the player wants Legendary Bojackan, they must apply for it with a background or take the Chosen Unique.<BR><BR>
#### Bojackan Duelist
* STM x 2 END
* Up to twice per Round, when you fail a Parry Roll, you may pay 4 END to Reflexively Block, Advanced Block or Power Block if you know these Powers.
* +Level x 5 Damage to all Sword Attacks.

#### Bojackan Warrior
* STM x 2 END
* Gain Level x 3 Resistance.
* They use MNT/4 as their Modifier for H2H Damage Rolls and the Parry Blast power. The power Multi-Kick uses MNT/3 as its Damage Modifier.

#### Bojackan Warlock
* The HP of Energy Strands increased to 200 x Level HP.
* When you use Energy Strands; you may double its Cost to Attack two seperate people. If you have two people Grappled with the strands on your turn, any Attack action you make applies to both people.
* +2 Ki Mod on Creation.

#### -=( Restricted Class )=-
This class must be applied for with a character background and approved by the GM staff. There will be a maximum of one Legendary Bojackan at any given time.<BR>
Legendary Bojackan
* +1 to your HP and Ki Mod
* +1 APR
* +1 +5% all Stats while in your Superform.
* Your Level is considered 2 higher, for the purposes of qualifying for and determining the effects of your Superform.



<h2 id="hr3">Icer</h2>
The various Icer forms all look different, some are giant monstrosities while others are small beauties - exactly what they look like is left mostly up to the will of the Icer, though all forms are snow white with a purple dome on their head encasing their brain, and often several such bubbles are located elsewhere on the body. These androgynous beings may even change gender aspects in between forms, though they are asexual beings. Icers live the longest life of any known race, and rarely reproduce. This is to keep the population of their planet down, and because they simply have no desire to unlike most races. This latter part might be due to the warrior-like society of the proud race where they fight one-on-one battles to ascend in society, even the Emperor is capable of being challenged for his position by any other Icer at anytime.<BR><BR>
Average Height: Varies<BR>
Average Weight: Varies<BR>
Life Span: 6,000 years.<BR><BR>
Interesting Traits: They are a kind of shapeshifter and can control almost exactly what they look like to some extent; nicknamed "Changelings". They own countless planets, hundreds of slave races, and have a small population of near 500.<BR><BR>
Example: Freiza (Freeza).

Statistics (53 additional points, max of 18 in 1 stat)<BR>

  | Stat | Base  |
|:---:|:------------|
|  Int  |   17      |
|  Mnt  |    20     |
|  Str |    22     |
|  Dex  |   25     |
|  Stm  |   25  |
  |  Spd  |  25  |

> Distribute 53 additional points, max of 18 in 1 stat.<BR><BR>
HP: 8 x STM + 25 x Level<BR>
KI: 14 x MNT + 25 x Level<BR>
LP: 17 x STM<BR><BR>
Every Level-up, Icers gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br><br>
At Level 1, pick five powers. <br>
Every Level-up, gain two powers.<br>
Every even Level (2, 4, 6, etc), gain one additional Power.


#### -=( Racial Features )=-<BR><BR>
(Phys) Icers can survive in almost any environment; including Deep Sea, Extreme Temperatures and Deep Space. They are also immune to the Grapple Power 'Choke'.<BR><BR>
(Phys) Icers can survive even after losing all of their LP. Despite their reputation of being "Immortal", they can actually be killed; its just incredibly difficult. Icers have Sub-LP equivalent to Level x 150.<BR><BR>
(Phys) Icers can Attack with their Tail. It is considered a H2H Attack, which has a +1 to Strike and deals 4d6 per Level. Once per two Rounds, you may perform an unexpected 'Surprise Attack' with your Tail, gaining +(Level) to its Strike instead, also making it AP/SP.<BR><BR>
  An Icer's Tail has 5% of their Max HP. It can be regrown in a rejuvenator in a Neo Week. Trying to strike their tail is at a -5 penalty and you can not use Multi=Attacks or Combos (They are too inaccurate to properly aim). You can not target an Icer's tail inside a Grapple with an attack. Reducing their Tail's HP doesn't nessicarily sever it; but renders them unable to use their Tail Attack until healed like a Critical Effect.<br><br>
(Phys) Icers have a tough layer of skin. Some have actual Armored plates. Regardless, they have a Nat Armor equal to their Base STM x 4.<BR><BR>
(Ment) Icers are able to project their will as a powerful Forcefield. This is a Reflexive Shield with HP equal to their Base MNT x 4. This Ki is almost a second layer of skin, so SP attacks function against this Forcefield as though the Attack were AP and the Forcefield was Armor.<BR><BR>
(Phys) Select one 'Affix' from the Affix list. You gain that Affix as a Racial Feature while in 'Form One' and is lost when changing Forms.<BR><BR>
(Phys) Icers begin in 'Form One' and gain additional Forms, as they Level up. As a Pre-Round Action, an Icer may advance by One Form. Instead, by spending an Action during the Round, an Icer may advance any number of Forms. An Icer may not reduce their Form to a lesser one, until Combat ends. In a fight, the first time an Icer advances a single form (One to Two, Two to Three, etc) during any round, they ignore the XP Penalties associated with the Superform. Each time an Icer advances one or more Forms; they restore 20% of their Maximum END, half of their Maximum Forcefield and half of their Maximum Nat Armour.<BR><BR>



#### -=( Racial Powers )=-

(Ment) 'Piercing Blast' - At level 1 an Icer automatically gains this power.<BR> This is an extremely powerful Ki Attack that many Icers know how to use. It is a Ki aAttack with a -2 to its Strike Roll. If it hits, it deals 1d6x10 Damage, +1d6x10 Damage per Level and costs 25 Ki per 1d6x10. The Attack is always AP and Auto-Critical. It gains SP at Level 4 and becomes Double-Auto-Critical at Level 9. When this KI Attack becomes SP, it increases the cost to 30 Ki per 1d6x10, but the Icer can choose not to use the SP effect (declared as such) on the narrow beam. This Ki Attack cannot be Countered and can only be used once every two Rounds.<BR> <BR> 

(Phys) 'Second Form' - An Icer may not select this Power until level 3.<BR> Icers have the ability to change forms and become stronger. All Form Stat changes are based on Stats from their Base Form (Form One) only. This form grants the following bonuses:
 * +10% All Stats, except INT.
 * When you select this Power; you have 10 Points to spend to increase your Stats further. Each Point distributed into this Superform, increases a Stat by +1%, to a Maximum of +5%. Once selected, this choice may not be changed. INT may not be increased.

(Phys) 'Third Form' - An Icer may not select this Power until level 6 and they must know 'Second Form'.<BR>  Following previous Form rules; this form grants the following bonuses:
 * +15% All Stats, except INT
 * When you select this Power; you have 20 Points to spend to increase your Stats further. Each Point distributed into this Superform, increases a Stat by +1%, to a Maximum of +10%. Once selected, this choice may not be changed. INT may not be increased.

 * Select one 'Form Affix' from the list when you purchase this Superform. You gain that Affix's benefit as a Racial Feature available when in this Superform and is lost when you change Form.<BR> <BR> 
(Phys) 'Fifth Form' - An Icer may not select this Power until level 12, and they must know Fourth Form and either have the 'Chosen' Unique or Submit a Background prior to first use.<BR> Following previous Form rules; this form grants the following bonuses:
 * +25% All Stats, except INT

 Be sure to record in your Logs how your Form has been designed!


#### -=( Form Affixes )=-<BR><BR>
These are special Racial Features to add greater customization to your Forms. You select one affix per Form, which applies to that Form only. Your choice in Affix is permanent once selected; but can be subject to change until the first time you use that Superform. Each Affix may only be selected once.

1) Your Forcefield may stop UP Attacks as though they were AP and works completely against SP quality of Attacks.<BR><BR>
2) Your Nat Armor (not Resistance) may treat AS, IA and UP Attacks as AP instead, if you choose to. <BR><BR>
3) This Form develops a Natural Weapon of some sort that may be used like a Sword. It deals 2d10 SP Damage per Level. It gains +2 Strike in Form 3, and AP in Form 4.<BR><BR>
4) You are granted Max Ki/25 damage to all Damage types (Charging does not affect this).<BR><BR>
5) This Form has a unique Attack Invent, that only this Form can manage to achieve for some reason. You gain a new Level 1 Ki or Sword or H2H Personal Invent that starts with 15 Base Invent Points.<BR><BR>
6) Your Form has several sets of redundant muscles; Use STR/4 for the STR Mod. instead of the regular STR/5.<BR><BR>
7) Your new Form is capable of channeling the Icer's signature Power; the Piercing Blast in a more intense, double-palmed attack style. Piercing Blast may be delivered using your H2H Strike or Ki Strike. It still uses the Ki Critical Hit table, but otherwise works as its respective type of Attack Strike you used for it. Piercing Blast may still only be used Once every 2 Rounds, but gains a +2 bonus to its Strike.<BR><BR>
8) Your new Form rapidly recovers; Regen Level x 2 HP and Ki.<BR><BR>
9) Your Form has an even longer and more prehensile Tail than normal. Once per two Rounds, you may make a H2H strike with no penalty to wrap your Tail around an Opponent's throat and constrict them. This Attack may not be Parried. If successful, it counts as if you Grabbed them and immediately applied the 'Choke' Power. The Defender continues to lose 1 END at the start of their Actions until they Break this Grapple. This does not consume one of Grab's Uses per Round.


<h2 id="hr4">Kibitain</h2>
Kibitain are tall humanoids with black eyes, white hair, long pointed ears, and pink or red skin. They are traditionally the defenders of good and servants of the Kaioshin. Though it is uncommon, Kibitain can also serve evil and demonic forces.<br><br>
The Kaioshin originally created the Kibitain and gave them free will to make them more useful. Eventually they began to breed amongst themselves, causing them to become a full-fledged race of their own (the Kaioshin still create them, albeit rarely). This is also where the schism between 'good' Kibitain and the 'evil' Kibitain began.<br><br>
There is a special bond between a Kibitain and any Path they choose to Champion, something of the greater's power becomes symbiotic with the Kibitain's own. This does not weaken either, but some Kibitain claim it is the source of all their powers. There are few Kibitain that choose to serve nothing.<br><br>
Kibitain live forever as long as the power they serve exists, aging no further past adulthood during the time. If the higher power ceases to be, or they sever ties to it, they begin to age normally. If they bond with another higher power, their aging halts but is not reversed.<br><br>
Average Height: 6'8" (203 cm)<br>
Average Weight: 185 pounds (83 kg)<br>
Life Span: Ageless, or 200-250 years (see above).<br>
Interesting Traits: Kibitain is, both, the singular and plural name for the race. Kibitain, of both genders, wear earrings as accessories.<br><br>
Example: Kibito.
  
  | Stat | Base  |
|:---:|:------------|
|  Int  |     21    |
|  Mnt  |     21    |
|  Str |    30     |
|  Dex  |   31     |
|  Stm  |   29 |
  |  Spd  |  21  |


> Distribute 53 additional points, max of 18 in 1 stat.<BR><BR>
HP: 15 x STM + 30 x Level<BR>
KI: 13 x MNT + 20 x Level<BR>
LP: 18 x STM<BR><BR>
Every Level-up, Kibitains gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br><br>
At Level 1, pick six powers. <br>
Every Level-up, gain two powers.<br>
Every even Level (2, 4, 6, etc), gain one additional Power.

<br>
#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>
(Ment) Kibitains can live in the mMortal Realms and in the Afterworld (Heaven and Hell). They have rules against Teleporting others with them into Heaven or Hell, without much higher permissions, unless those beings are allowed to be there.<br><br>
(Ment) Kibitain are granted Max Ki/25 Damage to all Damage (Charging does not affect this).<br><br>
(Ment) Kibitain can never have their free will taken from them, and are immune to any abilities that attempt to do so.<br><br>
(Phys) Kibitain have keen ears, which grant them +1 APR, and +3 to Initiative rolls.<br><br>
(Ment) Kibitain begin with the 'Sense Ki' and 'Sense Path' Powers.<br><br>
(Ment) When a Kibitain fights an opponent of a Path Opposite to their own (Order vs Chaos or Mercy vs Retribution, Balance/Pathless have no opposite), they gain +Level to all Strikes and Dodges, to a maximum of +8 and +Level x 10 to all Damage. If they fight someone from a Path other than their own that is not on the opposite Path, a member of the pathless or someone whose path is unsensible, then they get half of those bonuses instead.<br><br>
(Ment) Kibitains gain additional schools for free at Levels 1, 5, 10 and 15. If they do not have the INT to learn another school then this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning future schools. Kibitians can not know more than one school for every 9 INT they have.<br><br>




#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br>
(Ment) 'Kai Kai' - At level 1 a Kibitain automatically gains this power.<br> Kibitain can true-teleport. It costs 25% of their normal, Maximum Ki to use this power and the Ki cost can never be altered; like through Suppress Powerlevel. When used in Combat, it grants the Kibitain a MNT/5 bonus to a Strike or Dodge Roll. Up to one other person may be brought with the Kibitain if they are physically touching (usually, this means they are in a Grapple) by paying 25% of their Maximum Ki as well; the Kibitain can opt to pay this cost. This lets a Kibitain use Kai Kai to Dodge an Attack from outside a Grapple. This can allow them to Escape Combat and help other people Escape too (see Kai Kai Escape). The other person need not be willing; but they do get a Break attempt (even Flare Break) to escape the Grapple if they are unwilling to be Teleported.<br><br>
Unlike Instant Transmission, this power does not require the Kibitain to lock onto another person's Ki before Teleporting and can be used to teleport to any location the Kibitain knows of. However, a safety feature prevents them from teleporting themselves (or others) into hazardous environments; like Deep Space. So if a Planet is suddenly missing; they have a good idea thats the case. This power can not be used alongside Superspeeds.<br><br>
(Ment) 'Lay on Hands' - Taking this power requires the Kibitain to be level 3.<br> By touching themself or another person, a Kibitain can heal them. The Kibitain can heal someone for (2d6x10 per Level + Mnt Mod + Level x 10 ) HP, spending 25 Ki per 2d6x10. A person can only be healed by Lay on Hands once per RL day.

##### Kai Kai Escape<br>
Before a battle has started, if someone attacks you ('calls init'); you can not teleport away to avoid combat altogether. When you wish to leave a scene in this manner, declare you're doing so and check that no one intends to stop you. If they do wish to stop or attack you, Initiative is rolled as normal. On the first action you get, you may attempt to teleport away, declaring it. Anyone, who wishes to attack you, may make any basic attack or basic discharge, with add-ons as normal, against your single Dodge with your bonus from Kai Kai.<br><br>
If you dodge their attack, you successfully leave the scene. If they hit you, you have failed to escape and take damage; even if you reduce that damage to zero, you fail to teleport. It must be your action to teleport away. If you teleport and the person that you are fighting is also capable of teleporting with Kai Kai/IT, they may follow you as a pursuit.<br><br>
Failure to teleport away from combat still costs the power's normal amount of Ki and End.<br><br>
Note: If you use Freeze or Temporal Distortion; it still only allows you to avoid a single attack, not all attacks from multiple opponents.



<h2 id="hr5">Saiyan</h2>
Saiyan warriors are recognized throughout the Neoverse as ruthless mercenaries and powerful warriors. Though they seem like regular Human Beings, they have a love for battle matched by none. Though they look like your average human, they have a few key differences - namely the fact that they have a monkey-like tail, which isn't just for looks. This gives them the amazing ability to transform into giant ape-like beasts under the right circumstances. And, if that wasn't enough, in times of great need, they are known to ascend, granting them amazing powers, making them rather difficult to defeat.<br><br>
Those born on Vegeta are sorted by their Powerlevel, ranging from petty Low Class, to the mighty Super-Elite, and as such they are trained in the ways of battle.<br><br>
Average Height: 6'2" (187 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 260 pounds (117 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 60-80 years. (Though, Saiyans stay in their prime until they're nearly sixty.)<BR><br>
Interesting Traits: Monkey tail, barbarian-like warrior society ruled by King Vegeta, only race to ever revolt against the Icers and succeed. Though, very few have tried.<br><br>
Example: Goku (Kakarot), Vegeta, Nappa, Radiz, etc.
  
| Stat | Base  |

HP: 13 x STM + 25 x Level<BR>
KI: 13 x MNT + 25 x Level<BR>
LP: 18 x STM<BR><BR>
Every Level-up, Saiyans gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.<br><br>
At Level 1, pick six powers. <br>
Every Level-up, gain two powers.<br>
Every even Level (2, 4, 6, etc), gain one additional Power.

#### -=( Racial Features )=-<br><br>
(Phys) All Saiyans have a tail which is a source of great power and great weakness for them. Their tail is required for both 'Oozaru Transformations'. When a Saiyan's tail is Grabbed (they look so Grabbable!) they become effectively paralyzed. The Saiyan can no longer take any Actions, Dodge, Parry or Counter and their STR is considered to now be 2, until their tail is released. Grabbing their tail is treated as a normal Grab attempt with an additional -5 penalty; Declaring that you're targeting their tail.<br><br>
  A Saiyan's Tail has 5% of their Max HP. It can be regrown in a rejuvenator, regardless of the Saiyan's age in a Neo Week. Trying to strike their tail is at a -5 penalty and you can not use Multi=Attacks or Combos (They are too inaccurate to properly aim). You can not target a Saiyan's tail inside a Grapple with an attack.<br><br>
(Phys) Saiyans are fierce warriors, granting Max Ki/25 Damage to all Damage types (Charging does not affect this).<br><br>
(Phys) Saiyans are bred for conflict, giving them Base Max HP/700 to all Strikes and Dodges.<br><br>
(Ment) A Saiyan's tenacity lets them get stronger after suffering a Critical injury. They receive +25XP whenever you complete a fight (win or lose) with a Critical Effect that has a lasting penalty.Concussions or other temporary penalties that end when the Fight ends; do not count.<br><br>
(Phys) Saiyans are able to go on and on and on and on, usually when everyone else would rather they just stop. Thus, they gain STM x 1.5 END.


#### -=( Racial Class )=-<br><br>
With the exception of some of the Super Elite, Saiyans do not fall into a category based on birth. Instead, babies have their potential power judged and then they are placed into one of three categories. At creation you may chose which class you want to start as.<br><br>
1) Low Class (Goku)<br>
The lower rung of society; your Powerlevel was gauged to be very weak at birth and almost thrown out of the airlock. Though some use might come of you in society, just not with pride. Because of this, you were not afforded the same kind of opportunities to the extent of your brethren. Often times you were over-looked, and in the military your class is the eternal freshmen. Being part of the low-class of Saiyan society and not raised to be Warriors. These Saiyans begin initially weaker then their brethren, but have the potential to grow much stronger. You gain the following modifiers:
 * -3 to All Stats
 * While in any Racial Superform; you gain an additional +5% all Stats and +2 to your HP and Ki Mods.
 * Your Level is considered two higher for the power "Stress Transformation."
 * You may not learn the Power "Tail Training."
 * You may reach SSJ3 without the 'Chosen' Unique or a Submitted Background.
 * You have a 5% chance per Level to control 'Oozaru' (Maximum 100%).

2) Normal Class (Radditz, Bardock)<br>
You are the average Saiyan; trained from birth to make up the grunts of the military. Though not as strong as those above you, your people are very essential to the military and without them it would be nonexistent. You gain the following modifiers:
 * +1 Power every Level-Up
 * +2 Strike, Dodge and Initiative Rolls
 * 10% chance per level to control 'Oozaru' (Maximum 80%)

3) Elite Class (Nappa)<br>
At birth, your power was gauged to be very exceptional. Because of this you were chosen to be a squad leader or perhaps a royal guard. You gain the following modifiers:
 * +2 HP and Ki Mods, +1 to each at levels 6 and 12.
 * STR/4 Resistance
 * You begin with the 'Tail Training' and 'False Moon' Racial Powers.
 * 15% chance per Level to control 'Oozaru' (Maximum 90%)

#### -=( Restricted Class )=-
This class must be applied for with a character background and approved by the GM staff. There will be a maximum of one Royal Saiyan at any given time.<br><br>
4) Royal Saiyan or Super Elite (Vegeta)<br>
This category makes up one of two options. For those who had their power checked at birth, you are the top in the military. None stand above you, the generals and higher officers are all Super Elites. This class also covers those that are born into Royalty. The Royals fight the same as those below them, and on the battlefield none can match up to the wrath of a Saiyan Royal. You gain the following modifiers:
 * +1 HP and Ki Mods
 * +4 to all Stats
 * After the fight in which you first unlock SSJ, you gain a permanent +2 bonus to all of your base stats, stacking with the above.
 * After the fight in which you first unlock SSJ2, you gain a permanent +2 bonus to all of your base stats, stacking with the above.
 * After the fight in which you first unlock SSJ3, you gain a permanent +2 bonus to all of your base stats, stacking with the above.
 * You automatically start with the 'Tail Training' and 'False Moon' Powers. 
 * Knowing another Saiyan has a more advanced Super Saiyan form than you (as in, seeing it in Action with your own eyes) means you get a +50% bonus when using "Stress Transform."
 * Your character starts with 1000 additonal Credits. 
 * 20% chance per Level chance of controlling 'Oozaru'. (Max of 100%)<br><br>
 
 ##### -=( Racial Powers )=-<br><br> 
 
(Ment) 'Stress Transformation' - This power is automatically gained at level 1.<br> Saiyans could unlock a series of powerful transformations when their body and psyche are placed under extreme stress. This power may only be used if the Saiyan qualifies for Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, or Super Saiyan 3. Once per Neo Week, as your action, you may declare you are under extreme stress, usually with accompanying RP. Roll ((Max HP - Current HP)/(Max HP)x100 + (50 if you are in a deathmatch) + (50 for each ally that has died in this scene)+ Levelx10 - (100 if activating SSJ) - (150 if activating SSJ2) - (200 if activating SSJ3) - 1d100). On a 0 or higher, you immediately transform at no cost and heal for 50% of your maximum HP, Ki and END. If it would be impossible for you to fail this roll, then you may use this power even if you have previously used your attempt for that week. You may not use this Power while in Oozaru form.<br><br>
Note: Either party abusing the Deathmatch option (for or against the Saiyan) will result in penalties levied by the staff. Keep to the spirit of the power.<br><br>
Note: It is up to the Saiyan's Player to decide when their character is under enough stress to transform. This could be a deep and meaningful moment where their friend dies in their arms and everything is on the line, or it could be as silly as throwing a temper tantrum on an asteroid just to roll the power. The Saiyan's player decides, not anyone else, not even staff.<br><br>


(Phys) 'Tail Training' - This power can not be taken until level 2. <br> It allows the Saiyan to use their Tail in combat. Their tail is considered a basic Hand to Hand attack which has a +1 to Strike and inflicts 4d6 per level. Someone grabbing your tail no longer paralyzes you or reduces your STR and your Tail now has 10% of your Maximum HP in place of its original HP.<br><br>

(Ment) 'False Moon' - This power can not be taken until level 3.<br> This power allows the Saiyan to create a pale, shining orb in the air which mimics a moon. It allows a Saiyan to stare into its bright light and transform into their Oozaru form, even if the Planet they are on has no moon or if it's daytime. This costs 25% of your current END and Ki (including Charging Ki Pools). The transformation lasts until there are no opponents left (note that a rampaging Oozaru considers all non-Oozaru its enemy) or until the Saiyan's tail is cut off. Every Saiyan and Half-Saiyan in the combat who is capable of transforming into Oozaru does so, paying this power's cost even if they do not know it. This is a superform with the following traits:
 * +50% STR
 
 
 * +100% STM for purposes of calculating Hitpoints only.
 * Can uproot a piece of the scenery (usually a tree) as a non-action to use as an improvised sword that has -2 Strike but deals 1d6x10 damage per level. Plot relevant scenery and scenery with mechanically important traits may not be used in this fashion.
 * Can Bite as a basic Melee attack, even in a grapple. This deals your STR/4+STR Mod + Misc Modifiers AP/SP Damage. Inside of a grapple the attack gains UP but may not benefit from Bulk.
 
 * You may use the Mouthblast power even if you do not normally know it, and it deals 1d6x10 AP damage per level instead of normal.
 * Oozaru can hold up to two people, one in each hand. When grappling in this way, each person can break out against half of the Oozaru's STR to get free. If one escapes and the Oozaru has an action between the Escapee and the remaining Defender, the second person must deal with the Oozaru's full strength as normal. With the Goon unique, this is raised to 3/4 STR for two Defenders. 
 * An Oozaru may never be the defender in a grapple except if the attacker is similarly sized. This means another Oozaru, the Wyrm Dragon, or some NPCs.
 * The Oozaru may not use superspeeds when maintaining two Defenders in a grapple or benefit from move-speed dependant bonuses.
 * While the Oozaru grapples a single opponent, he may make strikes against people outside of the grapple as well as parry, dodge or block. You may also use superspeeds for attacks or defenses originating outside of the grapple.
 * This Superform -stacks- additively with Super Saiyan, Ultimate Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, and Super Saiyan 3 but the bonuses to all stats except INT are reduced by 10%.
 
 * When you attack or attempt to end combat while anyone else is nearby, roll (Your Control Chance)-1d100. On a positive result, nothing happens. On a negative result, randomize the target of the attack. On a result of 1 or higher, randomize the target of the attack. You may attack allies in this fashion, although friendly Oozaru may be exempt at that attacker's wish. If you were trying to end combat, then you must use an attack instead, which may not be a basic attack, Jumpkick or Eyebeams unless only basic attacks are available.<br><br>
Note: At the GM's discression, it can be a full moon out, causing all Saiyans to transform automatically as a pre-round action. They still need to pay the associated Ki and END cost.
Example: A USSJ Saiyan that goes into Oozaru form would gain +65% STR, +5% MNT/STM, +0% DEX/SPD. They would use +105% STM for purporses of determining their hitpoints only and they would benefit from STR/4.<br><br>
(Ment) 'Super Saiyan' - This superform may only be obtained through the "Stress Transformation" power.<br> In times of great need; very powerful Saiyans have been known to transform into a legendary warrior above all - a Super Saiyan. In this form, a Saiyan's hair turns golden and stands up a bit and their pupils become green. Their aura turns a bright, flaring gold. You gain the following bonuses:
 * +15% all stats (except INT)
 * +1 HP Mod
 * +1 Ki Mod
 * This costs 10% of your maximum base (no superforms!) END.<br><br>
 
 
(Ment) Ultimate Super Saiyan - This superform may only be choosen once you have obtained Super Saiyan by spending a power to aquire it.<br> The Ultimate Super Saiyan or the 'Ascended Saiyan'. This form is similar to Super Saiyan, but more physically powerful and unbalancing, sacrificing their ability to move. In this form, a Saiyan's hair will become a bit more spiky and he becomes more muscular. You gain the following bonuses:
 * +25% STR
 * +15% MNT and STM
 * +10% DEX and SPD
 * Use STR/4 as your STR Modifier.
 * This costs 10% of your maximum base (no superforms!) END.




(Ment) Super Saiyan 2 - This superform may only be gained through the power "Stress Transformation" after learning Ultimate Super Saiyan.<br> This form is a perfected version of USSJ; the Saiyan's hair stands straight up and grows a bit longer. Unlike USSJ, however - they retain their speed and manuverbility and get even stronger. This transformation may only be activated while Super Saiyan or Ultimate Super Saiyan is active. You gain the following bonuses:
 * +25% all stats (except INT)
 * +2 HP Mod
 * +2 Ki Mod
 * This costs 20% of your maximum base (no superforms!) END.

(Ment) SSJ Training - This power requires Super Saiyan 2<br>You have perfected your mastery over your transformations. This grants you the following benefits
 * Super Saiyan may be activated pre-round and costs no Endurance to transform into. This does not affect advanced forms of Super Saiyan. 
 * As an action taken while in Ultimate Super Saiyan, you may alter the form's bonuses--setting their SPD/DEX modifier between +10% and -100%. For every 1% of SPD and DEX you sacrifice you gain +2% STR. You may take this action even if you are in a Capture ball, stunned, or otherwise incompacitated. You may not do this while Oozaru is active or while Grappling.

(Ment) Super Saiyan 3 - This superform may only be gained through the power "Stress Transformation" after learning SSJ Training - additionally requiring the below note.<br> You immediately lose the power "Stress Transformation", having achieved the pinnicle of Saiyan potential. Very few to none manage to attain this power. This is a Saiyan's most powerful form that anyone even remotely knows of. His golden, spiked hair grows and falls all the way down to his waist and his eyebrows completely disappear. You gain the following bonuses:
 * +(20+Level)% all stats (except INT, minimum 25%)
 * +3 HP Mod
 * +3 Ki Mod
 * This costs 30% of your maximum base (no superforms!) END.
NOTE: SSJ3 requires being a Low-Class Saiyan, taking the Chosen Unique, or submitting a background for approval.



<h2 id="hr6">Yarkon</h2>
Yarkon's are not often seen, but their presence is known by the unique characteristic of physically absorbing energy from their surroundings in the form of light. What is more readily known is that they are often top-heavy, muscular, lizard-like creatures with a distinct lack of real eyes and insted a deep cavity of where they have something that could've been eyes in the past, now replaced by black discs that detect the existance of light and basic movement. Though it varies - most are large and lumbering with almost frail, small lower bodies but sport large arms capable of cutting through their natural habitat to create caves. They are oppertunitists by nature - often working together as raiders to steal energy from neighbouring civilisations and using it to fuel their planet without such luxuries as a sun.<BR><BR>
Average Height: 6' (182 cm)<BR>
Average Weight: 180 pounds (81 kg)<BR>
Life Span: 300-500 years.<BR><BR>

(Phys) Yarkons have only vestigial eyes. They can still detect the presence of light, but see their surroundings through other means. There are benefits, however. Yarkons are immune to the 'Taiyoken' and 'Zanzoken' Powers and suffer no penalties for Critical Effects to their eyes. They also begin with the 'Sense Ki' Power.<BR><BR>
(Ment) Yarkons are evolved for Battle, granting Max Hp/25 Damage to all Damage.<BR><BR>
(Ment) Yarkons do not have access to the 'Taiyoken' or 'Eyebeams' Powers. Should a School offer these Powers to a Yarkon, he may instead choose 'A Piece of Home' or an Offensive Ki Power instead; they do not consider the Powers to exist for prerequisites.<BR><BR>
(Phys) Yarkons are truly children of their planet: swallowing all light around them. Yarkons gain a special "Lightdrinker" Ki Pool that starts each combat at 0, but is filled by their Racial Features and Powers. Ki from this pool may not be spent and if the amount of Ki in the Yarkon's Lightdrinker Ki Pool ever exceeds their (higher of Maximum HP or Maximum Ki)/2, then they lose the excess in HP as a feedback explosion. This self-Damage cannot be reduced. Once the Feedback has occured, it empties the Lightdrinker Pool. This pool is emptied between Fights or while Unconscious.<BR><BR>
(Phys) Yarkons grow fat on the power of others and it's expelled violently through their pores. They add (Current Light Drinker Ki)/250 to their Strike and Dodge Rolls. (Current Lightdrinker Ki) x /100 x10 is added to all of their Damage. This bonus Damage counts as damage from ulk or PKU (it is never multiplied, added once in a Combo, etc), but can stack with other sources of Bulk and PKU Damage.<BR><BR>

#### -=( Racial Powers )=-<BR><BR>
(Phys) 'Light Drinker' - A Yarkon automatically gains this power at level 1.<BR>A Yarkon may activate or deactivate this Power as a Pre-Round Action or as an Action. While active, the Yarkon 'drinks' in light around them in a slight dimming of the lights (but not enough to hamper vision). The Yarkon's Resistance gains Level x 3 and they add the Ki Cost of any incoming Attack they take Damage from or successfully Parry, to their Lightdrinker KI Pool. This includes Addons. This isn't optional so long as the power is active.<BR><BR>
(Phys) 'Metabolize Light' - A Yarkon automatically gains this power at level 1.<BR>As an Action, a Yarkon may start to metabolize their Lightdrinker Ki into usable Ki that is added to their Charged Ki Pool. This allows them to lower their Lightdrinker Pool by up to their Level x 25 and then add the same amount to their Charging Ki Pool. This does not count towards their Charging limit. This power cannot charge into Charging Ki Attacks. You may use this inside of a 'Capture Ball'.

(Phys) 'Form Drinker' - You must be level 4 before taking this power.<br> A true terror; this Power is both the Yarkon's greatest strength and its greatest weakness. Activating or deactivating this power takes an Action. When activated, the Yarkon must nominate one opponent in the Battle. On that Opponent's turn; if they are in or choose to activate a non-Permanent Superform; they lose the Yarkon's Level x 1 in END and Yarkon's Level x 10 in Ki, while the Yarkon adds his Level x 25 in Ki to their Lightdrinker Pool. If the opponent loses END or Ki from this, then the Yarkon rolls 40 + (higher of the Yarkon's Base STM or Base MNT)/2 - Opponent's Base STM/2 - 1d100. On a 0 or higher, the Opponent loses all benefits from their Superform until the start of their next Action. If losing their Superform causes them to lose enough APR that they lose their current Action, their turn immediately ends. This does not work against Oozaru. However, if False Moon was used the Yarkon may "drink" the Ki from it, destroying it; granting the Yarkon 500 Lightdrinker Ki and causes all Oozaru to revert to normal.<BR><BR>

Losing access to your Superform reduces your Current and Maximum HP, Ki, END, et cetera. This may result in the opponent falling Unconscious.<br><br>
False Moons do, in fact, taste like false cheese.

(Ment) 'A Piece of Home' - This power can not be taken until level 5.<BR> This power takes an Action to activate or deactivate. It costs 25 Ki and 1 END for each Action (the Yarkon's or someone else's) that passes while it is active. While active, the Yarkon loses the benefits of any Superform they have active; as well as Splitform. In return, they cloak the entire battlefield in the eternal night of their homeworld. Anyone who isn't a Yarkon or Shadow Humanoid Dragon takes a -(Level/2) penalty to all Strikes, Dodges, and Taiyoken Saves. When someone affected by this penalty makes an Attack, they roll a 'Taiyoken Save' along with their Strike roll. If the Taiyoken Save fails; the result of their Strike Roll is reduced to 0. People may attempt to dispel the darkness on their Action by using 'Taiyoken'. The Yarkon must then succeed on a Taiyoken Save or this Power immediately ends (although it may be re-activated), instead of being affected by it as normal (since they're immune).<BR><BR>

 The normal stacking bonus to Taiyoken saves applies to and based on all Taiyoken saves; even one made through this Power.
