## Androids
Androids are sentient machines, constructed either from scratch or by heavily modifying an existing organism. In either case the result is a robotic warrior with amazing power capable of far more than a normal human. For hundreds of years, the Neoverse has been thriving to create artifical intelligence for good, evil and everything inbetween. It took many, many years but a group of scientists finally made a breakthrough: A fully sentient machine. It was capable of amazing feats that no human could possibly do without intense training - travel in space being the most prominent. Fortunately for the Neoverse, these scientists rarly shared how the managed to do it, because the Androids rebelled - unable to be controlled by petty humans. It was because of this that the creators decided to stop making them. But, from time to time someone comes across the blueprints and re-creates an android, adding personal touches to them be it impressive shielding capabilities or extreme firepower. Regardless of how, when or why they were created, they are potent warriors with amazing power.

Average Height: Varies drastically based on creator's preferences.
Average Weight: Several tons.
Life Span: Theoretically, androids are ageless. But, few models continue working after a thousand years.
Interesting Traits: Man-made machines, limitless options, mostly human-based (humans being generally the only ones with the technology to create them) but there are exceptions.

Example: Androids 16 through 20.

Stat	Base
Int	21
Mnt	21
Str	21
Dex	21
Stm	N/A
Spd	21
Distribute 50 additional points, max of 17 in 1 stat.

HP: 14 x STR + 25 x Level
KI: 14 x MNT + 25 x Level
LP: 17 x STR

Every Level-up, Androids gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic 1 to all Stats.

At Level 1, pick six powers.
Every Level-up, gain two powers.
Every even Level (2, 4, 6, etc), gain one additional Power.



-=( Racial Features )=-

(Ment) Androids can not take Powers from the Ki Awareness or Powering Up trees. If they would gain a Ki Awareness Power, they instead gain an Offensive Ki Power. A Powering Up Power instead gives them a Defense Ki Power. The Powers Rest and Rejuvenation do not exist for Androids and bypass them as requirements. Androids can never learn TK Powers and sources that give them are simply lost. Androids may not choose the Uniques Enhanced Awareness or Psionicist.

(Phys) Since Androids are machines, they can not be detected by any form of Ki Sense. Scouters give a location and direction, but Androids lack a Powerlevel. Androids themselves have a built-in Scouter, with a success chance of (60+Int)%, which allows them to communicate across any distance for free with any Scouter or dwelling with the Communicator Upgrade. Powerlevels; aside from the number, are indistinguishable from one another. They also have an internal generator that grants them Level x 10 Ki Regen and have no Ki Charging Pools.

(Phys) Androids have no STM Stat and no END. Costs of 1 END are ignored, but everything else (including END lost from things like Bruiser or being parried) causes them to lose 15 Ki per point of END. If a Ki Cost is multiplied; it is calculated before the additional 'End' cost is added as Ki. If they ever reach 0 Ki; they pass out as if they'd run out of END.

(Phys) Whenever an Android's STM Stat would go up from a School that gives no bonus to STR, they instead add the STM increase to their STR score. Bonuses from Uniques work the same way. In any other situation, unless otherwise stated, all gains from STM are simply lost.

(Phys) Androids can survive in normally-intolerable environments (such as Space, or Underwater), as they are machines. They do not need to breathe or sleep, and are immune to the Power 'Choke'.

(Ment) An Android's artificial intelligence allows them to memorize and analyze things far better than a living person can, though they're often somewhat uncreative. All of their invents have a base of 35 points, instead of 30.

(Phys) Androids, being the pure essence of technology, have the ability to upgrade themselves over time to improve their performance. An Android may select a new Racial Upgrade on every odd level. (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc). See Racial Upgrades later.

(Phys) Androids have a harder time improving themselves during Combat than living beings. Statbooster Invents for Androids start out granting 1 stat point per 9 invent points (instead of 7).

(Ment) When Charging a Ki Attack; Androids put double the Ki they would naturally Regen into the Attack, but do not Regen Ki while Charging an Attack. They do not have the normal Level x 3 limit to how many times they can charge into an Attack per Battle.

(Phys) Androids are built to be as efficient as possible in their movements. They gain Base Max HP/700 to all Strikes and Dodges.

-=( Android Models )=-
On Creation, you choose one of the listed models which functions like a racial class.

No Model
A basic Android with no specialized functions. Their lack of specialization gives room to more generalized improvements and allows them to be a little more resilient. You gain the following:

+4 All Stats (except STM)
+1 HP and Ki Modifier.
Additional +1 to their HP or Ki Modifier, chosen on Creation.
Gain additional Racial Upgrades at Levels 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Completed Programming
As an Action; you may gain the 'NM' marked benefits of any of the other Android Model Types (before their Completed Programming) until you use this Feature again. You do not gain Stats, HP mods, Ki mods or bonus Powers. You additionally may take an Action during Pre-Round phase, so long as it doesn't effect anyone else.
Barrier Model
This type has a unique shield generator, which allows them to create extremely potent barriers of energy. You gain the following:

+3 All Stats (except STM)
+1 HP and Ki Modifier.
(NM) You may spend up to 25 Ki per Level on a Reflexive Racial Shield. You stop 4 Damage (or 2 Damage SP) per Ki spent. You may use it an unlimited number of times per round. Against Combos; it still only works against one Attack.
Completed Programming
Your shield may now stop UP Damage at the rate of 1 Damage per 1 Ki spent per Level. Additionally, you may now use each version of this Shield (Normal, SP-Resistant, UP-Resistant) against each part of a Combo. Further, once per Defense this Shield may become Flaring, returning 20% (or 10% against Ki Attacks) of the Damage it stops as UP/AS Damage. In the case of Sword Multis; this Flaring only applies to one Damage roll.
Energy Absorption Model
These models have special crystals in the palms of their hands which can absorb energy they come in contact with. You gain the following:

+5 STR, +2 all other stats (except STM)
+2 HP Mod and -1 Ki Mod.
You gain the 'Parry Blast' Power.
(NM) You have a seperate Ki Pool called 'Drain Ki' where all of your drained Ki goes, similar to a Charging Ki Pool that does not Regen. Ki may be spent from this pool freely.
(NM) While you're the Attacker in a Grapple, you may Drain a victim as an Action. This steals an Opponents Levelx1 in END and Levelx10 Ki. The Android gains the drained Ki to its 'Drain Pool'.
(NM) When you use 'Parry Blast', you do not suffer the normal -5 penalty to the Strike roll. Other strike penalties, such as against Multi-attacks, apply normally. On a successful Parry Blast result, you gain all Ki spent on the Attack plus Addons. Alternatively, you may recover 1 HP for every 2 Ki you would have absorbed in this way.
Completed Programming
Whenever you drain someone's Ki in a Grapple, you get a cumulative +5% STR for purposes of Grapple Checks until the current Grapple ends. When someone uses 'Flare' to Break out of a Grapple with you; you gain 10% of their Maximum Ki added to your Drained Ki pool. Finally, you may reflexively spend 500 Ki to lower your STR Mod divisor for the duration of one Action or one Parry Blast (STR/5 becomes STR/4. STR/4 becomes STR/3).
Hell's Flash Model
These Androids can remove their hands at the wrists, to reveal powerful energy cannons built into their arms. You gain the following:

+5 MNT, +2 all other stats (except STM)
+2 Ki Mod and -1 HP Mod.
(NM) Removing or Re-attaching your hands may be done as an Action or as part of the Pre-round.
(NM) While your arms are attached; you may launch them as part of a H2H Attack that explicitly states it uses fists. This allows you to use your Ki Strike in place of your H2H Strike, your MNT Mod in place of your STR Mod and both your H2H Misc Mods and Ki Misc Mods for Damage. This Attack may benefit from Bulk or PKU, but not both. This attack may be a Grab attempt, reeling in the Target; but your arms will be Unattached afterwards.
(NM) While your arms are not attached, your Ki Attacks are enhanced. Gaining +4 Ki Strike and +100% Damage, but costing 100% more base Ki (not Addons). Eyebeams and Mouthblast cannot benefit from this. While your hands are unattached, you may not use H2H or Sword Attacks (including the Ki Attack from Ki Enhance), but you may maintain a Grab as if a cable is wrapped around the target.

Completed Programming
You may attach or unattach your hands at will without spending an Action to do so and even do it Immediately; such as during an Action like a Combo. You may always perform H2H Attacks, as if you'd launched your fists and Immediately recovered them. Finally, the Base Ki Cost is only increased by 50%.

Template: (Dice + Mnt Mod + Misc mods ) x2 + PKU
Multi Template: ((Dice ) x (Mnt Mod) + Misc mods ) x 1.5 + PKU
Ki Cost: (Base Cost ) x2 + PKU

-=( Racial Powers )=-

(Phys) 'Zero Shift' - You cannot take this power until you've reached level 3.
This Power modifies an Android's existing propulsion system, allowing them to create a controlled, temporary overload which results in a short burst of amazing speed and maneuverability. When used, this grants the Android +5 to their Strike or Dodge Rolls for an Action. This even applies against TK Attacks and stacks other valid Superspeeds. 'Zero Shift' costs 5% of your Maximum Ki to use; +5% of your Maximum Ki per previous use during the same Round.

(Ment) 'Advanced Targeting Computer' - This power can not be taken until level 5.
You may use your Scouter to Lock-on to a Target as a Pre-round Action. This gives you a cumulative +2 bonus on all Strike and Dodge Rolls on that Target for the rest of Combat, to a maximum of +Level/2.
(Ment) 'Completed Programming' - This power can not be taken until level 6.
When it's taken, the Android reaches the pinnacle of their performance; refining themselves to truly staggering levels. The exact nature of what this power gives depends on the Android's Model and is shown in each Models' section.
(Phys) 'Generator Enhancement' - This power can not be taken until level 7.
When taken, this Power increases an android's in-Battle Ki Regen by Levelx5.
(Phys) 'Defense Matrix' - This power can not be taken until level 8.
Once per Battle, the Android can project an exceptionally powerful forcefield; which can protect against virtually any Attack. As it's not an actual shield, this power works normally against SP, UP and US attacks. However, it can not be used in conjunction with any type of Blocking, Auras or Shielding and Resistance does not apply when using it. This Power divides the damage taken from an attack by 8 and functions against all Attacks in a Combo situation, combined. Against attacks which do not deal Damage, Defense Matrix stops them entirely as if it used Freeze. It Costs 300 Ki to use and can not be used in a grapple and it is not reflexive.
Template: (Damage taken - Armor)/8


-=( Android Upgrades )=-
1) Afterburners
An Android's propulsion system is modified by adding a new cooling system or some good old engines strapped onto their back. This lets the Android add the higher of their MNT or STR to their SPD, for purposes of determining how fast they move in MPH or LYPH. This doubles the Ki Cost of the Power used. If they're concerned about efficiency; the Android can choose not to use this Upgrade.

2) Discern Power
With this Upgrade, a few modifications are made to their Scouter and how the Android picks up Powerlevels; allowing them to memorize a person's aura. There is no limit to how many people they can now remember. You do not recognize any auras that you sensed before you had this Upgrade, until you sense them with it.

3) Enhanced Espionage Unit
With this Upgrade, an Android can fine-tune its generator to give off a special, detectable Ki signiture like the ones given off by actual people. You're able to utilize the 'Current Powerlevel' displayed on your sheet (Failing this, use ((Current HP + Current Ki) x ( STR + DEX + SPD )) / 12 ). While unconcious, you have a static Powerlvel equal to 1% of your normal value; representing your generator running 'idle'. This can be turned on or off at-will. In Combat, this can allow an Opponent to use Sense Ki's Ki-Lock on you.

4) Nano-Repair Systems
With this Upgrade, an Android gains a colony of microscopic robots inside and on them which can repair damaged circuits, machinery and damage all over their body. If an Android suffers a Critical Hit and receives penalties from it (basically, if a limb is broken or worse) the nano machines can repair it quickly outside of Battle.

When out of Battle, the Android can heal any broken, shattered, or lost body part within three Real-Life Hours. Since all their energy is going in to these repairs, they won't be able to Regen Ki until the process is over. If an Android was KO'd from its Ki getting to 0; it must Regen to at least 1 Ki before Nano-Repair Systems take over. If the limb has been cut off; the Android needs to find the lost limb in order to reattach it. They can create a completely new one, but this takes an entire Neo week in place of the three real life hours.

5) Nanowave Telepathy
With this Upgrade an Android can send out special transmissions that will play a message in the database of another Android or Scouter that it has Scouted (previously or otherwise). This creates a special two-way frequency of communication, which doesn't require a hidden Android to reveal its location. People with a scouter that has the communicator addon may also be targeted and respond.

6) Scouter Cloaking
With this Upgrade, an Android has various small modifications made to itself which conceal the energy it gives off just from functioning, creating a means to mask the emissions specific kinds of Scouters look for. Each Level of this Upgrade blocks only a specific kind of Scouter; so taking Rank 4 would stop the Android from being detected by Rank 4 Scouters, but not the others. This Upgrade only needs to be taken once, as it Upgrades itself over time.

For every two Levels total you have, you may select a Scouter level that the Upgrade protects against and may be taken out of order. Once you reached level 12, you would have all of them, making you undetectable to all buyable Scouters and give -180% against other Androids and Ghetti detection attempts.

1 - Rank 1 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
2 - Rank 2 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
3 - Rank 3 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
4 - Rank 4 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
5 - Rank 5 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.
6 - Rank 6 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.

7) Solar Fiber
When this Upgrade is taken, the Android replaces its hair or other exposed skin with special fibers that gather solar and other energy from the surrounding area to help alleviate some of the stress on the Android's generator. Because of this, the Android is able to recharge and repair themselves much quicker; HP, LP and Ki Regen is double the normal rate Out of Combat. This also halves the time it takes for Nano-Repair Systems to repair Critical Effects, if they have it.

8) Scouter Jamming
Requires four levels or more of the Scouter Cloaking Upgrade.
This Upgrade transmits a special frequency that can scramble any Scouter or scanning device within a mile of the Android producing it. Any scouter or Scanning Device in this area will not function and nothing inside the radius can be Scouted or Scanned. This Upgrade can be turned on and off at will and effects even the Android's own Scouter when on.

9) Scouter Upgrades
An Android's built-in Scouters are far from perfect, but on the other hand that means there's plenty of room for improvement. This Upgrade improve the accuracy of the Android's scanning ability, to the point where they can actually assess various parameters of a fighter's abilities. This Upgrade only needs to be taken once, as it Upgrades itself over time; gaining one Rank for every two total Levels the Android has.

Each Rank of this Upgrade, your Scouter gains +20% success rate. For each Rank, you may select one STAT other than INT. You can Scan a target within sight distance; functioning as a 'Sense' roll, you can learn their exact STAT values that you can scan for. In combat; this costs an Action.



10) Accelerated Nano-Repair
This Upgrade requires the Android to have 'Nano-Repair Systems' before it can be taken.
Through the use of this Upgrade, an Android can drastically accelerate the speed at which their Nano-Repair Systems work, but not done very efficiently. This gives them Regen of Levelx5 HP at the cost of reducing their Ki Regen by Levelx5. This Upgrade can be turned on or off Pre-round or by spending an Action to do so.

11) Suppression Coils
While most Androids strive to improve themselves, some merely wish to be more like those around them. This Upgrade provides Androids with the ability to scale their performance down, if necessary and saves them energy as a nice bonus. This functions similarly to the 'Suppress powerlevel' Power; the Android reduces their Strike and Dodge by -1, their Damage by 10% and reducing their Ki Costs on everything by 5%, per penalty to a maximum of -1 per two Levels. When paired with the 'Enhanced Espionage Unit' Upgrade, this causes your 'Powerlevel' to also drop by 10% for each -1 penalty. The maximum penalty you may impose upon yourself is -10.

12) Tactical Analysis Programming
This Upgrade requires the Android to have Rank 3 or higher 'Scouter Upgrade' before it can be taken.
Once per Round, you can spend an Action to Scan your opponent; revealing their current HP, Ki or END. This Upgrade can be taken up to three times; each time it's taken, it lets you learn another aspect of the Upgrade. When you have multiple Upgrades, you discern all of the selected attributes together.

13) Multi-Lock Systems
This Upgrade requires the Android to have 'Advanced Targeting Computer' before it can be taken.
When you use your 'Advanced Targeting Computer' to lock on in a fight, you may lock-on to as many combatants as you choose.

14) Hard Light Weaponry
This upgrade allows the Android to produce super-high-tech laser weaponry; now able to acquire the 'Ki Shaping' or 'Psionic Entemperment' Powers; ignoring their usual limitations on Androids against taking these Powers. It costs only 5 Ki per Level each swing to use, and the Android gains +5 x Level Misc Mod Damage when attacking.
