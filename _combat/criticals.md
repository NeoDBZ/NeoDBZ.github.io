Critical Hits
Recovering from Criticals
Some critical hits are temporary and only lasts for that attack or the remainder of the fight, such as Power Blow or Disorientated. This means there is no associated recovery time, because it's not long-lasting.

When recovering from critical effects, such as broken bones, record the end time of the fight to use as the start of your healing time. Criticals typically takes some time to heal from, especially without the aid of Racial Regeneration, a rejuvenator or a hospital. It takes 1 Neo week (1 RL day) to recover from a level one critical effect without the aid of a rejuvenator, during which you can't fight. If you do, the healing time is reset. Double criticals take 3 Neo weeks (3 RL days) to recover from without the aid of a rejuvenator. Triple criticals and any lost limbs are permanent, unless a character visits a hospital or a rejuvenator to fix the injury or has some advanced form of self-healing, capable of curing this level of Critical injury. If you have been inflicted by more than one critical effect, the times and costs to recover from them are cumulative, adding together with each additional injury.

Miscellaneous Critical Hits
Some criticals can be inflicted out of combat, on a person who is unable to protect themselves. These may also not be on par with normal criticals. Like, having your fingers broken, for example. This isn't the same as having your arm itself be broken (although it might be just as painful), so in this case, you can go to a hospital and typically have it healed within a negligible amount of time without any penalty beside its cost. It takes 100 Credits to heal each critical of this type. Each time you get another critical of this type, the cost to heal it doubles. Hospitals enjoy repeat customers and know to exploit the necessity for their aid.

Special Limb Criticals
Tails
If you have a tail (regardless of what kind of tail it is) and your leg suffers a critical hit, there's a 50% chance your tail is hit instead. Your opponent rolls this additional chance, after landing on a leg critical to confirm if it is the tail or not.

If it's a Normal Critical, your tail is damaged and all attacks with it take -8 to Strike.
If it's a Double Critical, your tail is broken and can not be used for combat until healed (heals at the same rate as an arm).
If it's a Triple Critical, your tail is severed from your body and is considered a lost limb. It may not be used until replaced. This invokes a -10 strike and dodge penalty, due to the misbalancing nature of having no tail. You reduce this penalty at a rate of -2, per Neo Week (1 RL day) - as getting used to the new balance of life without one. Saiyans that start the game without their tail, do not recieve this penalty.

Eyes
Loss of an eye is pretty painful and throws off your aim, incurring a -2 Strike penalty. But losing both Eyes, inflicts a permanent -5 to all Strikes and dodges unless they can be replaced. On the up side, you're now immune to the power Taiyoken.

Multiple Critical Hits
If you roll a crit that breas the same limb twice, you may decide to break the other limb or to upgrade the current crit to the next level. If you break the ribs twice then they may only be upgraded to the next level. If a limb has been destroyed then nothing further may damage it.




 When you start losing limbs, maybe the fight has gotten a LITTLE to intense.

Sharp Criticals
These are the critical hits for extremely sharp objects, Kienzans, weapons, and the like.

Sharp Criticals function differently than H2H or Ki criticals, Sharp critials have their effect applied before the damage is rolled, and before any damage reduction is made. Power and Mighty Slash's +50% damage is applied to the total damage that was rolled (including bulk and other modifiers), and is applied before any reductions are made to it.

The effects of removing a limb or the additional Hand to Hand criticals Sharp Double Crits cause are still possible to prevent if the victim somehow prevents the UP damage of a Sharp crit - such as through a UP shield, Ki's Ending, or enough Resistance. If any damage is taken, however, all of the critical's effects take place.

Sharp criticals can still be reduced by Advanced block, as normal.

Normal Critical Hit

1 - 59 Power Slash The Damage is now Unpreventable (UP)
