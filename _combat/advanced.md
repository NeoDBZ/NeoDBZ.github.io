Special Moves
These are attacks which are simple enough for everyone to do, but uncommon tactics enough to be listed separately from Basic Attacks. The powers listed here are defensive and meant to help you protect someone else in the midst of battle, which can be a rather difficult task if your opponent knows what they're doing. Remember: You can only use these abilities during a fight or in special circumstances during an event, if the GM allows you to do so.

Remember to read the details on Deathmatches under Basic Combat; Types of Combat to learn more about saving lives.

Power Name: Interception
Level: Basic
Cost: 3 End, 4 for a Multi + half the base cost of the ki attack if successful.
UPR: Unlimited
Description: You and your ally come up with a clever plan to lure your enemy into a false sense of victory; you dive between your ally and his opponent during his attack, not unlike the Take the Blast manuver. However in this one, you're already reaching back to swat the ki attack away. This is great for defending those who are unable to defend themselves.

You must have the parry Blast Power in order to declare the use of this manuver, when your ally is the target of a ki attack. Roll a Hand to Hand strike roll, using your STR/5 in place of your DEX/5, with a -7 penalty to your roll. You can choose to parry multi attacks and combos, but you take an additional -7 penalty to the strike roll. On a natural 20, you automatically succeed with the parry and it costs you no endurance or ki. A blast parried in this way may never be parried back.

Due to the bait and switch tactic used here; on a failure both targets take full damage from the attack as well as additional effects,

You must use a Superspeed when using this manuver for it to succeed. Using this manuver consumes the last action from your APR, if you don't have an action in the initiative you may not use this manuver.

Power Name: Taking the Blast
Level: Basic
Cost: 1 End
UPR: Unlimited
Description: This isn't an actual attack, but rather a defensive maneuver. You try to place yourself infront of an incoming Ki attack and thereby intercepting the blast before it hits someone else. You make a Dodge roll with a +4 bonus. Before your opponents strike is rolled; the person you're defending declares a defense and then Taking the Blast is resolved; If you successfully beat their attack strike roll, then you've taken the blast in place of the person you were protecting and you take the damage instead of the original target. If you fail, the attack has bypassed your attempt and the original target defends with their declared defense.

You can't block, parry, dodge (obviously) or Counter, but you can use reflexive shields and auras normally.

You can only attempt this maneuver if you have actions left in the round and it makes you lose your next available action. You can't do this while blinded, stunned, Frozen, from within a Cap Ball or Involved in a Grapple. You must use a Superspeed to use this power.



Power Name: Tackle
Level: Basic
Cost: 1 End
UPR: Unlimited
Description: This isn't an actual attack, but rather a defensive maneuver. If someone is being attacked by a H2H or Sword attack, you may try to tackle them out of the way. It deals a small amount of damage to the person you're trying to protect, but in most cases it ends up causing them less damage than the attack itself does.

First off, the person you're wanting to tackle must want to be protected, if they don't - you can't tackle them. Assuming they allow it, they declare a defense in the event that Tackle is unsuccessful. You roll a Dodge roll with a +4 bonus against the attack's strike. If you succeed, the person you're tackling takes (1d6+(STR+SPD)/2) UP damage (no other damage mods are added to this attack) from the tackle, while you take the attack yourself.

You can't block, parry or dodge (obviously), but you can use reflexive shields and auras normally.

You can only attempt this maneuver if you have actions left in the round and it makes you lose your next available action. You can't do this while blinded, stunned, Frozen, from within a Cap Ball or Involved in a Grapple. You must use a Superspeed to use this power.

When it says the person that's being tackled must agree to it, this is an OOC agreement.
Escape from a Fight
If someone wants to run away from a scene, you must first roll initiative to determine if you were able to or not. You can not run away without doing so during combat. If you're already in combat, then you must spend three consecutive actions doing nothing but fleeing. You must dodge all attacks aimed at you during this time and if you're hit then you have to start the process over again. If you manage to successfully escape, then you must calculate your flight speed and determine how fast you can go. If your flight speed is higher than your opponent(s), you successfully escape combat and run away and they can't catch up with you. If their flight speed is higher, they can catch up to you and start the combat again after you run, using a new initiative. If you're trying to escape and your opponent is not flying, it takes only a single action and you automatically escape. You can't escape combat if you're not flying.

There are special escape rules for powers which are actual teleports (Kai Kai and IT), which are listed with the powers themselves. If someone tries to escape and you have one of those powers, then you can teleport after them and re-declare initiative if you can sense them. They can try to flee again if they wish, but you can do this as many times as you can use your power and providing you can sense them.

In the event that you're unable to escape because you're terrible at dodging or too slow, you can utilize the power Taiyoken or Cap Ball, amongst other things in order to produce a 3-action string where you can effectively escape undeterred. While your opponent is Blinded or Contained, they cannot pursue you or know where you went, so long as you hide your powerlevel.

When escaping from a fight that has hostile spectators; you can effectively ignore them. Spectators tend to be too far away from the fight to make any meaningful attempt to pursue you and even if they did, they would be classified as interfering with the fight - which could land them in trouble if they were told not to.

Notes:

Space Flight can't be used in combat and can't be used to escape a combat. If you have this power, then you must successfully escape before you can activate Space Flight to leave the planet. You can still be intercepted in space if they are capable of long-range ki sensing and have a faster space flight power.
Rescuing/Escaping with allies
There are a few factors that apply when you are trying to escape a battle with an ally that is unable to do so themself either due to their flight speed, dodge ability or being incapacitated.

It takes an action to retrieve your ko'd/dead ally before you can start to flee. If they are concious, they can initiate this action. -Picking up and trying to fly off with someone as deadweight is a little taxing and causes you to fly at reduced speeds, you Fly at only 75% speed. -You have -5 to dodge while carrying a fallen ally. If you are struck and your concious ally is the target, you can release them to allow them to dodge - but must start over from the initial action of grabbing them. -When blocking an attack; the fallen ally takes 20% of the damage you recieve after Damage Reduction. And fleeing must begin over again. -When using space flight to carry someone, you must pay the ki cost of space flight for them, too. -While carrying someone you may only make attacks or parry if you have the unique Goon, otherwise you may do neither. -If a dodge is failed from a hand to hand or sword attack; it lands on whichever of the two was targeted. However hitting the target being carried does not set back their 3 actions of fleeing on the main guy. -If a dodge is failed from a ki attack both people take full damage. You may use an aura to protect your ally, if you do not use one to protect yourself. This sets back your 3 action escape as normal.
Surrendering
If you don't want to get knocked out or be called a coward for running away, you can simply surrender. During a fight, you can concede defeat between attacks, even when it's not your turn to do so.

The only attacks you can't surrender between, are combos - with exception of sword combos.

For example; if you had an action string of GGG F, you could throw three attacks in quick succession, but if one of those attacks KO'd or caused a Concede, you're not required to roll the damage on additional attacks.

Conceding is always be done before damage is rolled or immediately following a damage reduction.

AFK during combat.
If you must go AFK; please warn your opponent out of courtesy. Even if you simply have to type AFK at an inopportune time, we understand that real life takes prescedence - especially in an emergency.

When a player is afk for 15 minutes or longer during combat, you are able to take credit for the victory as if the scene has ended. The person simply gives up and leaves.

For Deathmatches the rules are slightly different. If a player AFKs in a deathmach, it does not end after 15 minutes. You and the player have to resolve the fight from where it left off - you're expected to save your sheet in whatever status it was left in. The disconnected player must resolve this within 24 hours or arrange a date for a resolution or risk a GM intervening to declare their character dead. Neither participant may RP or Fight without GM consent, since it often complicates matters.

For Team Fights or events; the player is simply skipped. If they do not return quickly enough, they may lose their actions all together. With warning, a GM can choose to allow a player to retrieve lost actions so long as it supercedes actions currently taking place. For example:

Goku was AFK while Krillin and Freiza fought. Freiza was about to Piercing Beam Krillin and end his life; when Goku returned to take the blast with 2 of his remaining actions that are left to be resolved. He cannot 'lose' one of these unspent actions, but he could use his actions to attack Freiza normally as if it was prior to his offensive action. He also would not be able to Cap Ball Freiza, now knowing he planned to Kill Krillin with the next blow

Fighting in Hostile Environments
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you find yourself in a situation that may not be favourable to your health. Varying types of Environments effect different races. For example; some are immune to space, but noone is particularly immune to moulten lava.

When fighting in an Environment that is dangerous to you without sufficient protection, your Life Points (not Health Points) and Endurance drains at a rate of 1% (minimum of 1 point drain) for each of your APR used. If you're not immune to the environment, you do not regenerate HP, LP or Endurance. When you're down to 1 LP, you're considered unconcious and this drain ceases. Endurance will continue to drain until it hits 0 and you're rendered unconcious in that way.

Left in an unconcious state in a hostile environment, you die within the Neo Hour once you have 1 LP remaining.

Of course, there's protective suits that can defend against these environments, which can be found in the Stuff to Buy portion of the PHB.

Examples of Environments
Space:
Races that are immune to Space are listed in the PHB. Using the power Space Flight, a Spaceship or a Spacesuit can temporarily grant immunity.

Lava:
No races are immune to the searing temperatures. This is what makes a planetary explosion so dangerous. Space flight could allow someone to travel through this, protected by their ki.

Poison Atmosphere:
Races that are immune to Space, could be immune to this kind of environment. Using the power Space Flight, a Spaceship or a Spacesuit can temporarily grant immunity.

Water:
All Races are immune to drowning, so long as they are conscious. It's a pretty easy thing to shield yourself with ki against water.

Gravity:
No race is immune to extreme gravity, such as Jupiter's core or a Black Hole. There is no way to survive such extremes. Lesser gravity, could simply range from a hindrance to dangerous.

There are likely other Environments that could be created, but this is just a basic idea.

Grappling
Quick Notes: For the purposes of clarity and understanding of these rules, the person CONTROLLING THE GRAPPLE, is considered "Attacker" and the person BEING HELD is the "Defender" - this naming theme is specific to the roles and not which end of an attack you find yourself at. You can shield attacks in a grapple unless it specifically says otherwise. To use grappling mechanics, ensure you understand how it works.

1. Initiating a Grapple
Power Name: Grab Level: Basic Cost: 1 End UPR: 2/Round Description: You reach out and try to grab ahold of someone, be it by the arm, leg, or whatever. This attack deals no damage to your opponent and has a -4 penalty to its Strike roll. This attack is used to begin a grapple. The defender can only choose to dodge the Grab, though they can let themselves be hit. Grabs can't be parried.

You can only attempt to grab twice per round. If you try to grab someone who is charging a blast, they have the option of immediately firing the blast at you - hitting you automatically as you go to grab them. You can't block the attack and being hit by the blast cancels your attempt to grab them.

Grabs can not be used as an attack for any Counter and can not be used as a part of a Combo. Even if you're Ambidexterous, you can not Grab and use a basic attack on the same action. Attempting to grab someone with an advanced grab power consumes the 1/round use of the grab ability and 1 of your regular grab attempts.

2. Attacker Options
The Attacker in a grapple can do several things to the Defender, while he has them at his mercy. When reffering to a grapple between two people, refer to this section. Attacking into an existing grapple are completely seperate rules and should be treated as such. On their action, they may do any of the following;

Kick
Elbow
Punch
Knee
Any power from the Powering Up tree
Eyebeams
Mouthblast
A Dagger's Basic Attack
Use a Grappling Attack or Advanced Grapple Power
Release the Defender
Notes:

All of these moves require no strike roll to hit, but a d20 is still rolled to check for a critical.
Critical hits may not escalate beyond the first level. If you roll an escalation, reroll the 1d100.
You can not use any Block powers while in a grapple.
As the Attacker, you can choose to release the Defender in response to an attack from the Defender; the Attacker can try to Dodge the attack, but can't parry or block it.
3. Defender Options
The person being grabbed is even more restricted in what they can do, and may only use the following powers. When reffering to a grapple between two people, refer to this section. Attacking into an existing grapple are completely seperate rules and should be treated as such. The Defender, or person being held in a grapple, is even more restricted in what they can do and may only use the following as their action:

Elbow
Knee
Eyebeams
Mouthblast
A Dagger's Basic Attack
Flare (only to break the Grapple)
Break Grapple
Shift Grapple
Notes:

All of these moves require no strike roll to hit, but a d20 is still rolled to check for a critical.
Critical hits may not escalate beyond the first level. If you roll an escalation, reroll the 1d100.
You can not use any Block powers while in a grapple.
Flare can not be used to damage an opponent in a Grapple.
4. Manipulating a Grapple
Sometimes you simply do not want to be part of this dance. When this is the case, the Defender may attempt to escape the controlled position he is in, by one of the following:

Breaking a Grapple
There are two methods of attempting to break out of a grapple: using one's own strength, or trying to use your energy to force your opponent away from you, flaring them off. Flaring requires you have learnt the Flare power. The grapple is successfully broken if the result is below 60.

Using just your strength, the formula is: Template: {1d100-(Defender's STR/2)+(Attacker's STR/2)} Using the power Flare, the formula is: Template: {1d100-(Ki Charged/4)+(Attacker's STR/2)}

Shift Grapple
The Defender can try to shift the Grapple in their favour and switch roles to become the person in control, instead of escaping. The formula is the same, as if he were trying to break the Grapple using his strength and succeeds on a roll of 60 or lower, only the end result is different. You can not use the power Flare to shift a grapple.

Template: {1d100-(Defender's STR/2)+(Attacker's STR/2}

5. Attacking into a Grapple
Sometimes, the easiest target might be your ally or you're given permission to fire on friendlies. Attempting to attack people who are involved in a grapple can usually result in your unintended target being thrown into your strike or other nasty side effects. Both people involved in the grapple are restricting one another, so defending themselves is near-impossible. Attacking into a grapple may not have critical effects, but can become AP/SP.

Hand to Hand and Sword attacks
You declare a target as normal, when making a Hand to Hand or Sword attack roll. If the Attacker is the intended target, he may choose to let go of the Defender in order to Dodge the outside interferance - he cannot block or parry. If the Attacker does this, the Defender can make a Shift Grapple roll to prevent him from escaping the grapple and insted is hit by the attack and the roles of the original Attacker and Defender, are switched, with the old Defender now in control of the grapple as the Attacker. Alternatively, the Attacker may choose to try and use the Defender as a shield, when targetted. The Attacker rolls a shift grapple check and on success, the Defender is automatically hit insted. Using this option takes the Attacker's next available action in the round.

If the Defender is the initial target of the attack, he can try to force the Attacker of the grapple to take the hit insted, by making a shift grapple check. On success, the Attacker is automatically hit insted. The Defender and Attacker does not shift roles.

Ki attacks
When firing a Ki attack into a Grapple, all participants in the Grapple take full damage (Splitforms are only one person) from the blast. When a Ki Attack targets the grapple, the Defender may roll a shift grapple check before damage is dealt. If the result is below -40, the Defender has broken free from the grapple and may dodge (he may not block or parry), while the Attacker is automatically hit. If the result is higher than 40, the Attacker if they so wish, can let go and attempt a dodge (they may not block or parry) while the Defender is automatically hit. If the result is between -40 and +40, both are hit as normal.

6. Multiple Grapple Rules
Only two people may grab a specific person at any given time, this includes Split Forms. Treat additional entries to the grapple as a seperate grapple, producing a grapple 'chain', if you will. So for example, we have an Attacker and Defender. If someone were to grab the Attacker, he is both Attacker and Defender in two grapples. Alternatively, if the Defender was the target, he is now Defender in two grapples and must make a seperate Break/Shift for each of them. You may only be the Attacker in one of your grapples, at any one time unless you have the Goon unique. Grabbing onto an existing Grapple simply takes an action and is automatically successful.

You may not shift to, or initiate Muy-Thai Clinch or Back Grapple while a player is already grabbed. If you already have someone grabbed in one of these holds, you maintain your position but you are unable to use any of the Muy-Thai Clinch or Back Grapple abilities, even if the ability does not release the person. If you have the Defender in a rear naked choke when someone else joins the grapple, you must release it on your next action.

When multiple people have a hold on one person, neither of them can use the powers Throw, Body Slam or Ramming Body Slam until one of them releases their hold. They can still use attacks which do not end the grapple.
