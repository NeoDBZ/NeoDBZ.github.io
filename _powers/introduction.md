Powers are abilities beyond simple attacks that all fighters in the NeoDBZ universe may learn. Each power belongs to a different 'power tree,' which is a general classification of what exactly the power does. This node includes rules which apply to all powers in this section.

Picking Powers
At creation, no more than half your starting powers can be put into a single power tree. When you level up, you can't pick multiple powers from the same tree unless stated otherwise.

If you gain a power from a school/racial feature/unique and you already know it, you can learn a different power from the same tree, but must follow the standard power rules. If you already have all the powers from that tree, you instead gain nothing.

Roleplaying Powers
Do not roleplay ki attacks as hand to hand or sword attacks (or vice-versa), or being able to read minds with telekinetic powers.

Besides that, all powers can be roleplayed however you want, but please keep it within reason, you should not roleplay a multifireball as a single blast, or a regular block as a complete negation of an attack. Failure to follow reason will likely get you ridiculed by fellow players, but don't be afraid to ask for guidance if you think you need it.

Power Format
The format this section lists powers are as follows:

Power Name: The name of the power you're using. Level: This is the level of the power, see below for details. Type: One, two, or three, see below for details. Cost: How much Ki and/or Endurance the power costs. Please remember that all powers cost 1 End, even if it isn't listed. The only exceptions to this rule are powers which restore Endurance. UPR: (Uses Per Round) The number of times you can use the power in a given round. If it states 1/Round, it means you can use it once in any round, but never twice. If it says 1/2 Rounds, it means if you use it one round, you can't use it the next, but on the round after that, you may use it again (once). Description: Details on what the power does and/or what it typically would be roleplayed as. Template: The mathematics of the power, typically showing the damage it does, if it does any. If the Template and the Description contradict, use the power's description and inform a GM of it, so it can be fixed in future updates.

Power Levels
Powers within each tree are divided into several levels: 1, 2, 3, X, X2, and Z.

Level 1 powers can be taken anytime, and have no prerequisites.
Level 2 powers require you have a level 1 power from the same tree.
Level 3 powers require you have a level 2 power from the same tree.
Level X powers require you to have all level 1, 2, and 3 powers from the same tree.
Level X2 powers require you to have all level 1, 2, 3, and X powers from the same tree.
Level Z powers require you to have all other powers within the tree before you take them.
Power Types
Type One powers are powers which are considered to be either offensive or extremely strong. This is the only type of power which can sometimes cause you to take EXP penalties if they are used too early in battles. Type Two powers are considered neutral, they can be used both offensively and defensively, or do some sort of supportive function. Type Three powers are considered to be defensive or passive powers.

Racial Powers
Racial powers and superforms always cost a power unless it specifically states otherwise in the power description.
Racial powers do not count as a power tree, so you can spend as many powers as you wish in your racial tree as you level, as long as you meet the requirements to do so.
