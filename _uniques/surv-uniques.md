### Alternate Understanding
Your mind works to understand the nuances of combat only to make yourself more of a stalwart. Your energy is best used defensively, and your training has made use of that fact.

* You gain +2 to your Ki Modifier.
* On creation, start with two powers from the Defensive Ki or Telekinetics Tree.
* Your Ki Shield has MNT x 15 HP.
* Your Ki Shield regenerates your MNT on each of your actions.
* Your Ki Shield ignores Armor Piercing.
* You may use all non-Invent Auras and Shields as if you were two levels higher than you actually are.
* All your Shield Invents automatically have the 'Reflexive' add-on for free and using a Shield Invent Reflexively does not increase the ki cost.
* You begin with a Shield Invent with a base of 20 invent points instead of the normal 30. This is not increased by racial features or other uniques. This invent shield may be used once per round rather than the standard once per 2 rounds.
* You take half XP penalty for using an Invent Shields in combat early.
