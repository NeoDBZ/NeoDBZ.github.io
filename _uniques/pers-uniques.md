### Avenger
You have a very strong resolve when it comes to championing your cause. Whatever it is, your blood boils when facing people who are your opposite.

To take this unique, you must adhere strongly to one of the five paths (Order, Chaos, Mercy, Retribution, or Balance) as one of its 'Champions'. Mercy vs Retribution, Order vs Chaos. Balance and Pathless have no opposites.

* You gain +2 to all Strike and Dodge rolls.
* You gain +level x 5 to all damage.
* You begin play with the 'Ki sense' and 'Sense Path' powers.
* You have a special 'Ki sense power'; no one may hide their alignment from you, except Androids, Sorcerers or with Enhanced Awareness. This does not mean you can also sense their powerlevel automatically; when you roll, declare 'auto alignment'. You cannot Ki lock with Sense Path.

When fighting a character whose Path is different (but not opposite), you have the following benefits against that character:

* Gain an additional +1 to all Strike and Dodge rolls.
* Your opponent does not count natural 20's as a Critical against you, but they still Auto-hit or Auto-defend as appropriate.

When fighting a character whose Path is opposite to yours, you have the following benefits against that character:

* Gain an additional +2 to all Strike and Dodge rolls.
* Gain an additional +level x 5 to all damage.
* If you receive a Level 1 Critical from an opposed-Path Character, it is negated entirely, while Level 2 and Level 3 use the same d100 result on the chart one level lower.
* nce per battle, if you were damaged by an opposed-Path Character since your last action, you can spend a turn reciting your creed and steeling your resolve to restore Levelx50 HP and Ki and Levelx2 END. Upon taking this action; nominate one opposed-Path character. You may not surrender, you may not flee and you must pursue that person til defeat - yours or theirs.

Notes:

* Since Androids can't sense people's paths, this unique is of dubious benefit to them at best.
