### Brilliant Ki User

You're not just smart with your usage of Ki, you're creative. You know how to use it in the ways it comes hardest to most, and you know how to combine those methods to create something wholly yours.

- At creation, begin with two extra powers.
- Every level up you gain an additional power and can pick powers from the same tree.
- You gain an extra Invent at levels 2 and 3. They may not be shield invents.
- Once every two rounds, you can use the feature 'Reflection'. This allows you 'Mirror' a non-racial (Except Paiku / Konackans) invent you missed with and attack a second time. You do this in the same action you missed, costing you no extra actions. However, you must pay the invent's cost again. Your opponent has to react as if it is an entirely new attack and keep all the bonuses the attack had when you first used it with no changes.

You can not use 'Reflection' and then 'Remote'/'Double Remote' or vice versa. And may not Reflect after a 'Freeze'. You have to repay the cost for all Superspeeds and Enhancements you used, keeping them for the reattempt (meaning you do not lose limited-use powers, such as Final Fist or MCT). The defender then chooses a new defense; following normal power limit rules.
