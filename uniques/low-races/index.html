They are quite strong with their Ki and have a talent for flying, but are physically one of the weakest races. Chou-jin are born in Heaven, created from a sinless soul and granted eternal life in a playful form. Though, most tend to grow into a mature being far wiser than their appearance gives them credit. Their life in Heaven is always short as they are simply given bodies, allowed a few days to adjust to them, then sent into the Neoverse. Like babies few ever remember their first few days. Furthermore, they may have been born in Heaven, but not all stay to a straight path.</p> <p>Despite their inability to breed (due to their young age), these beings do have different genders. Being that the Chou-jin are not raised by any parental figures, they have no common cultural ties. One of the few ties these children share is that most look like large dolls, which makes sense as they were bodies with a soul grafted on them. On the other hand, many end up being taken care of by an adult, who worries about a child wandering around alone. In particular, Triclops are noted for having a special liking of these ageless children.</p> <p>Average Height: 3’3” (99 cm) Average Weight: 40 pounds (18 kg) Life Span: Ageless. Interesting Traits: Though unable to breed; Chou-jin have different sexes. Most look like Russian dolls.</p> <p>Example: Chiaotzu.</p> <p>Stat Base Int 18 Mnt 20 Str 8 Dex 8 Stm 9 Spd 12 Distribute 27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat.</p> <p>HP: 8 x STM + 10 x Level Ki: 15 x MNT + 30 x Level LP: 15 x STM</p> <p>HP Mod Increase at: 4, 8, 12, etc. Ki Mod Increase at: 6, 12, 18, etc.</p> <p>Every Level-up, Chou-jin gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic +1 to all Stats.</p> <p>At Level 1, pick six powers. Every Level-up, gain two powers.</p> <p>-=( Racial Features )=-</p> <p>(Phys) Due to their small size, Chou-jin always have +4 to Dodge rolls.</p> <p>(Phys) Chou-jin start with the Basic Flight power and do not have to pay Ki to use it. Other flight powers still cost Ki as normal. Chou-jin gain a bonus to all Strike and Dodge rolls according to the form of Flight they’re using: Basic Flight gives a +1 to all Strike and Dodge rolls. Advanced Flight gives a +2 to all Strike and Dodge rolls. Boosted Flight gives a +3 to all Strike and Dodge rolls.</p> <p>(Ment) Chou-jin are physically weak, but make up for it with mental prowess. All of a Chou-jin’s Ki attacks can gain +10 Damage per 100 Max Ki that they have available (Charging does not increase this damage). Whenever an attack is enhanced with this bonus, declare it and pay your Levelx15 additional Ki, which does not count towards ‘Enlarged Ki Blast’. Apply this damage at the end of your damage, like Bulk - it’s not multiplied by anything. Template: ((Max Ki x10)/100). Alternatively, you may decide not to pay a Ki cost and add ((Max Ki x6)/100) damage instead.</p> <p>(Ment) Chou-jins start with a Regular School of their choice at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another school, this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning future schools. Schools gained in this way grant double the normal stat bonus.</p> <p>-=( Racial Powers )=-</p> <p>(Ment) ‘Improved ESP’ - The Chou-jin must have the ‘Minor ESP’ power before taking this power. With this, the Chou-jin can communicate for no Ki cost across any distance with anyone they have ever come in contact with, as if they have sensed the target. ‘Improved ESP’ is two-way: If you contact someone, they can respond to you even if they do not have this power or without sensing you.</p> <p>(Ment) ‘Mental Barrier’ - This power is automatically obtained at Level 5. The Chou-jin are able to tap in to their Ki and manipulate it to grant a constant form of protection. This gives a Resistance value based on your MNT/4. Stacking with other forms of Resistance.</p> <h2 id="ligon">Ligon</h2> <p>Ligons are a small, green-skinned people with four eyes. They are renowned for both their ability to manipulate time and their unrelenting refusal to provide any details about their home world, Ligon. This paranoia is so widespread that it often follows Ligons to other planets they live on, such is the case of Liquius where even the humans and reptiles on the planet feel the same paranoia about world visitors. Though one would be wise not to say this to them, Ligon are very much distant relatives to frogs. Though they are humanoid, they are amphibians, not mammals.</p> <p>When Ligons evolve from tadpoles, they are very similar to baby humans (save for the extra eyes and green skin!). There, they begin to learn to walk and adjust to living bipedal lives. Despite being amphibians, Ligons have a strict sense of honor and religious duty as well as mate for life. Furthermore, finding a Ligon that is not deeply devoted to the Kaioshins is especially rare, even for those who grew up outside of the cultural boundaries of Ligon and Liquius.</p> <p>Average Height: 3’5” (104 cm) Average Weight: 80 pounds (36 kg) Life Span: 70-90 years. Interesting Traits: Frog-like creatures, four eyes, green skin.</p> <p>Example: Guldo.</p> <p>Stat Base Int 18 Mnt 16 Str 8 Dex 10 Stm 12 Spd 10 Distribute 27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat.</p> <p>HP: 11 x STM + 20 x Level Ki: 12 x MNT + 20 x Level LP: 15 x STM</p> <p>HP Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc. Ki Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc.</p> <p>Every Level-up, Ligons gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats and an automatic +1 to all stats.</p> <p>At Level 1, pick Six powers. Every Level-up, gain two powers.</p> <p>-=( Racial Features )=-</p> <p>(Ment) Ligons have an unusual mastery of Ki, gaining Max Ki/25 damage to Ki attacks (Charging does not affect this).</p> <p>(Phys) The Ligon’s secondary pair of eyes gives them an advantage in combat; providing them with a +2 to all Strike and Dodge rolls and immunity to the ‘Zanzoken’ power. If a Ligon is blinded by ‘Taiyoken’ power (or something similarly blinding), the Ligon loses these bonuses for the rest of the round.</p> <p>(Ment) Ligons are immune to their own type of ‘Mind Freeze’.</p> <p>(Phys) Due to their small size, Ligon always have +4 to Dodge rolls.</p> <p>(Ment) Ligons start with a Regular School of their choice at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another school, this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning future schools. Schools gained in this way grant double the normal stat bonus.</p> <p>-=( Racial Powers )=- Both of these powers are considered Telekinetic powers and as such Super Speeds cannot be used with or against these powers.</p> <p>(Ment) ‘Time Freeze’ - The Ligon must be Level 2 before taking this power. Three times per round, a Ligon can hold their breath to slow down time, during which only they can move. In combat, everyone else is frozen in stasis and unable to even perceive the world around them. It’s simply a blank until the Ligon allows time to resume. The Ligon may use this power after a failed Dodge or Parry to give themselves enough time to Block, Power Block, or Advanced Block instead. This costs 3 End per use. By spending two Round uses of this power, this allows a Ligon to take up to their Levelx2 Actions as a single Action, as long as none of those extra actions have any direct impact on an opponent or attended objects. This means that all attacks are out, but things like Charging (even charging into an attack!) is okay. The Ligon can charge, use items that do not affect another person, pick up unattended items or similar actions. The Ligon must spend 3 END per extra action taken, in addition to any normal costs they might need to pay. Since time does not actually pass, no Regen occurs during these “extra” actions. “They, also, do not count towards the duration of power and effects.” WUT</p> <p>(Ment) ‘Mind Freeze’ - The Ligon must have the ‘Time Freeze’ power and be Level 4, before taking this power. Usable once per round, a Ligon may focus their time-warping abilities on an opponent’s mind and body, rendering them unable to move at all–even to defend themselves! This is resolved as a Telekinetic attack against all opponents, costing 10% of the Ligon’s Current Ki (including any Charging Ki Pools and Megacharge Ki Pools!) and 3 End. It has a -6 Strike Penalty and the Ligon must roll separately against each target they want to ‘Mind Freeze’. Temporary bonuses to strike (such as Focused, for example) must be paid for separately for each strike roll. If it hits, the target becomes “Time Locked.” While Time Locked, the victim can do nothing but roll (40+(Their MNT or STR)/5 - (The Ligon’s MNT)/5 - 1d100). On a 0 or higher; they break free of the psychokinetic hold and may act normally on their next action. On a -1 or lower, the Ligon may pay 10% of their current Ki and 3 END to keep them Time Locked until their next action. This can last up to a maximum of the Ligon’s 2+(Level/4) consecutive actions.</p> <p>While someone who is Time Locked is unable to defend themselves, any attacks aimed at them become Locked as well. The attack is held in suspended animation mere inches from the target. When the Time Lock ends (either because its duration elapses, the Ligon chooses not to pay or because the victim broke free), the pending attacks are resolved with no defense or reflexive actions, except the use of Auras and Shields. After all reductions, any attacks that deal damage only deal 20% initially. For every Action the Victim takes after, they continue to take 20% until 100% of the damage has been recieved. Attacks that don’t deal damage are simply negated against someone Time Locked. Als, the level of all incoming Critical Hits are reduced by one category (AC is negated). If the Ligon using this power is killed or rendered unconscious while they have a victim Time Locked, then not only does the Lock end but all attacks against the victim automatically fail.</p> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 You R.
